        <h1>The History of Blancpain</h1>
        <p class="meta">January 2025 · 9 min read</p>
        <p class="intro">Since 1735. The world's oldest watch brand. From the Swiss Jura mountains to the depths of the ocean, Blancpain has pioneered watchmaking for nearly three centuries.</p>

        <h2>Jehan-Jacques Blancpain's Beginning</h2>
        <p>In 1735, Jehan-Jacques Blancpain registered as a watchmaker in Villeret, Switzerland, establishing what would become the world's oldest watch brand. The small village in the Bernese Jura would remain Blancpain's home for over two centuries.</p>
        <p>The Blancpain family passed the craft from generation to generation, each adding their expertise. The watches became known for their precision and reliability, earning a reputation that spread across Europe.</p>

        <h2>The Quartz Crisis</h2>
        <p>By the late 1970s, the quartz revolution had devastated the Swiss watch industry. Like many traditional manufacturers, Blancpain struggled. The last member of the founding family, Frédéric-Emile Blancpain, died in 1932 without heirs. The company changed hands several times and nearly disappeared entirely.</p>
        <p>In 1983, Jean-Claude Biver and Jacques Piguet acquired Blancpain. The company had no factory, no workers, and no inventory—just the name and its history.</p>

        <h2>Jean-Claude Biver's Vision</h2>
        <p>Biver's strategy was brilliantly contrarian. While the industry chased quartz, he declared: "Since 1735, there has never been a quartz Blancpain watch. And there never will be." This became the brand's famous tagline.</p>
        <p>Rather than competing with quartz on price, Biver positioned Blancpain as the ultimate expression of traditional mechanical watchmaking. He focused on complications, craftsmanship, and exclusivity.</p>

        <h2>The Fifty Fathoms Legacy</h2>
        <p>Blancpain had created the Fifty Fathoms in 1953—the first modern dive watch. Developed in collaboration with the French Navy's combat divers, it featured a unidirectional rotating bezel, luminous markers, and 91.45 meters (fifty fathoms) water resistance.</p>
        <p>The Fifty Fathoms predated the Rolex Submariner and established many features that would become standard for dive watches. Under Biver's leadership, this heritage became central to Blancpain's identity.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Six Masterpieces</h2>
        <p>In 1991, Blancpain unveiled its "Six Masterpieces"—six watches demonstrating mastery of traditional complications: ultra-thin, moon phase, perpetual calendar, split-seconds chronograph, tourbillon, and minute repeater. The achievement proved that a small manufacture could compete with the greatest names in watchmaking.</p>
        <p>The 1735 Grande Complication combined all six complications in a single watch, cementing Blancpain's position in the haute horlogerie pantheon.</p>

        <h2>Swatch Group Era</h2>
        <p>In 1992, SMH (later Swatch Group) acquired Blancpain. Nicolas Hayek recognized the brand's value and provided resources for expansion while preserving its independence and character.</p>
        <p>Under Swatch Group ownership, Blancpain expanded its manufacture capabilities while maintaining the artisanal approach that defined the brand. Each watch continued to be finished by hand, with movements decorated to the highest standards.</p>

        <h2>Ocean Commitment</h2>
        <p>Since the Fifty Fathoms' creation for French Navy divers, Blancpain has maintained deep connections to the ocean. The Blancpain Ocean Commitment initiative supports marine research, conservation, and underwater exploration worldwide.</p>
        <p>The brand sponsors scientific expeditions, partners with conservation organizations, and produces documentary films about ocean preservation. Limited edition watches support these initiatives while celebrating marine heritage.</p>

        <h2>Innovation and Tradition</h2>
        <p>Today, Blancpain continues to innovate within the framework of traditional watchmaking. The manufacture in Le Brassus produces movements with exceptionally long power reserves—some exceeding a week on a single winding. Complications remain a specialty, from simple moonphases to grand complications.</p>
        <p>The Fifty Fathoms has evolved while maintaining its essential character—still the professional's choice for diving, still finished to haute horlogerie standards. The Villeret collection preserves classical watchmaking in its purest form.</p>
        <p>Nearly three centuries after Jehan-Jacques Blancpain registered as a watchmaker, the brand he founded remains committed to mechanical excellence. Innovation is indeed their tradition.</p>
