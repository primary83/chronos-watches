        <p class="lead-paragraph">Choosing between mechanical and quartz isn't just about preference—it's about lifestyle. Understanding the different maintenance requirements can help you pick the right watch for how you live.</p>
        
        <h2>The Short Answer</h2>
        <p>Mechanical watches require significantly more care than quartz watches. They need regular wearing or winding, protection from magnetism and shocks, and professional servicing every 3-5 years. Quartz watches mainly just need battery replacements every few years.</p>
        <p>But that simple answer doesn't tell the whole story. Let's break down what each type actually demands from you.</p>
        
        <h2>Daily Attention Required</h2>
        <p><strong>Mechanical watches</strong> need daily interaction. Manual-wind watches must be wound every day. Automatic watches need to be worn regularly—if you don't wear them for a day or two, they'll stop and need resetting. You also need to be mindful of shocks, magnets, and extreme temperatures throughout the day.</p>
        <p><strong>Quartz watches</strong> ask almost nothing of you daily. Put it on, take it off, that's it. They're not affected by position, magnetism rarely impacts them, and they can sit unworn for months without any consequence.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Maintenance Comparison</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily care:</strong> Mechanical needs winding/wearing; Quartz needs nothing</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Mechanical loses/gains seconds daily; Quartz stays precise</li>
                <li><strong>Service interval:</strong> Mechanical every 3-5 years; Quartz every 5-10 years</li>
                <li><strong>Service cost:</strong> Mechanical $200-$1000+; Quartz $50-$200</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic sensitivity:</strong> Mechanical highly sensitive; Quartz mostly immune</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Long-Term Maintenance Costs</h2>
        <p>This is where the differences become stark. A mechanical watch service involves disassembling hundreds of tiny parts, cleaning them ultrasonically, replacing worn components, re-lubricating everything, and precisely regulating the movement. This typically costs $200-$500 for standard movements, and $500-$1500+ for complicated or luxury calibers. You'll need this every 3-5 years.</p>
        <p>A quartz watch mainly needs battery replacements ($20-$50) every 2-5 years. A full service every 10 years might cost $100-$200. Over a decade, you might spend $100-$300 maintaining a quartz watch versus $500-$3000 for a mechanical one.</p>
        
        <h2>Durability and Resilience</h2>
        <p>Quartz movements are inherently more durable. Fewer moving parts mean less can go wrong. They handle shocks better, aren't bothered by magnets, and maintain accuracy regardless of position or temperature variations.</p>
        <p>Mechanical movements are more delicate. A hard knock can damage the balance wheel or hairspring. Strong magnets can magnetize components and destroy accuracy. They're affected by gravity, temperature, and even how you move your arm throughout the day.</p>
        
        <h2>The Intangible Factor</h2>
        <p>Here's what the maintenance comparison misses: many watch enthusiasts consider mechanical watch care part of the pleasure. Winding your watch each morning becomes a ritual. Hearing it tick, knowing you're keeping alive hundreds of years of horological tradition—that's the soul of the hobby.</p>
        <p>If you view watches as pure tools, quartz makes logical sense. If you view them as companions, art, or mechanical marvels, the extra care required by mechanical watches becomes a feature, not a bug.</p>
        
        <h2>Which Is Right for You?</h2>
        <p>Choose quartz if you want grab-and-go convenience, hate adjusting time, travel frequently across time zones, need pinpoint accuracy, or have a limited maintenance budget.</p>
        <p>Choose mechanical if you appreciate craftsmanship, enjoy daily watch interaction, collect watches as a hobby, value heritage and tradition, or want something that can be passed down for generations.</p>
        <p>Many collectors own both—quartz for practicality, mechanical for passion. There's no wrong answer, only what fits your life.</p>
