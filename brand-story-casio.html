        <p class="lead-paragraph">What began as a quest to create a watch that wouldn't break when dropped became one of the most iconic timepiece lines in history. The G-Shock didn't just survive drops—it survived being run over by trucks, frozen in ice, and thrown from buildings. It became indestructible.</p>
        
        <h2>Casio: From Calculators to Watches</h2>
        <p>Casio Computer Co., Ltd. was founded in 1946 by Tadao Kashio in Tokyo, Japan. The company initially focused on calculators, producing the world's first compact all-electric calculator in 1957. This expertise in miniaturized electronics would prove crucial when Casio entered the watch market.</p>
        <p>In 1974, Casio introduced its first digital watch, the Casiotron. It was one of the world's first watches with an automatic calendar, setting the stage for Casio's reputation as a digital watch innovator.</p>
        
        <h2>The Birth of G-Shock: Project Team Tough</h2>
        <p>In 1981, Casio engineer Kikuo Ibe dropped his father's watch and watched it shatter on the ground. That moment sparked a mission: create a watch that would never break. Ibe assembled a three-person team and set out to develop what seemed impossible—a shock-resistant digital watch.</p>
        <p>The team established the "Triple 10" concept: the watch must survive a 10-meter drop, have 10-bar (100 meters) water resistance, and offer 10-year battery life. For two years, they tested over 200 prototypes, throwing them from the third-floor bathroom window of their office building.</p>
        
        <h2>The Hollow Structure Solution</h2>
        <p>The breakthrough came when Ibe observed a girl bouncing a rubber ball in a park. He realized that if the module could float inside the watch case like the ball's center, it could survive impacts. This led to the revolutionary hollow structure design—a module suspended within a cushioned cavity, protected by a shock-resistant outer case.</p>
        <p>In April 1983, the first G-Shock, the DW-5000C, was released. It looked unlike any watch before it—bulky, angular, and unapologetically rugged. Initial reception in Japan was lukewarm, but everything changed when G-Shock reached America.</p>
        
        <h2>American Success and Cultural Icon</h2>
        <p>G-Shock found its audience among American skaters, surfers, and hip-hop artists who needed watches tough enough for their lifestyles. A legendary TV commercial showed a G-Shock being used as a hockey puck, surviving slap shots. Sales exploded.</p>
        <p>By the 1990s, G-Shock had transcended its tool watch origins to become a fashion statement. Limited editions, collaborations with artists and designers, and an ever-expanding range of colors and styles made G-Shock a streetwear essential.</p>
        
        <h2>Technological Evolution</h2>
        <p>G-Shock continuously evolved its technology. Tough Solar, introduced in 1998, brought solar-powered charging. Multi-Band 6 enabled automatic time synchronization via radio signals from atomic clocks worldwide. The Master of G series introduced specialized models for aviation (Gravitymaster), diving (Frogman), and land exploration (Mudmaster).</p>
        <p>Bluetooth connectivity and smartphone integration arrived in 2012, keeping G-Shock relevant in the smartwatch era while maintaining its core identity as an indestructible timekeeper.</p>
        
        <h2>The Metal Evolution: GM and MR-G</h2>
        <p>While the original G-Shock used resin cases, Casio eventually developed full-metal G-Shocks that maintained the shock-resistant properties. The MR-G line, introduced in 1996, represents the pinnacle of G-Shock—titanium construction, sapphire crystals, and prices that rival Swiss luxury watches.</p>
        <p>These premium G-Shocks proved that the concept could scale upward without losing its soul. A $4,000 MR-G is still, at its core, the same indestructible tool watch philosophy.</p>
        
        <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
        <p>G-Shock's influence extends far beyond horology. It's been worn by everyone from Navy SEALs to fashion models, from astronauts to musicians. The brand has collaborated with Supreme, BAPE, Stussy, and countless other streetwear labels. It appears regularly in films, music videos, and on the wrists of celebrities.</p>
        <p>More than 100 million G-Shocks have been sold since 1983, making it one of the best-selling watch lines in history.</p>
        
        <h2>Beyond G-Shock: Casio's Watch Portfolio</h2>
        <p>While G-Shock dominates, Casio produces other notable watch lines. The Edifice collection offers motorsport-inspired chronographs. Pro Trek serves outdoor enthusiasts with altimeters, barometers, and compasses. The classic F-91W, introduced in 1989, remains one of the best-selling watches ever made—simple, reliable, and under $20.</p>
        
        <h2>G-Shock Today</h2>
        <p>Four decades after that first prototype was thrown from a window, G-Shock remains the benchmark for tough watches. The lineup spans from affordable classics to premium limited editions, but every model carries the same DNA: a watch you can trust in any situation, an icon of durability that turned a broken watch into a billion-dollar legacy.</p>
