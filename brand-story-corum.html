        <p class="lead-paragraph">Corum has never followed rules. From watches made with actual gold coins to movements displayed in transparent cases, Corum has spent decades proving that Swiss watchmaking can be unconventional, artistic, and wildly creative.</p>
        
        <h2>La Chaux-de-Fonds Founding</h2>
        <p>Corum was founded in 1955 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, by Gaston Ries and his nephew René Bannwart. The name derives from the Latin word for "quorum"—a gathering of minds—reflecting the founders' collaborative vision.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, Corum positioned itself as a creative house willing to experiment with unconventional designs and materials. This willingness to challenge norms would define the brand.</p>
        
        <h2>The Coin Watch</h2>
        <p>In 1964, Corum introduced what would become one of their most recognizable creations: the Coin Watch. Using actual gold coins—including $20 American Double Eagles—Corum created timepieces that were both functional watches and numismatic treasures.</p>
        <p>The technical challenge was considerable: hollowing out a coin thin enough to house a movement while preserving the coin's integrity required exceptional skill. The Coin Watch became a favorite of collectors who appreciated both horology and numismatics.</p>
        
        <h2>The Golden Bridge</h2>
        <p>In 1980, Corum unveiled the Golden Bridge, featuring a linear baguette movement visible through a sapphire crystal case. The movement's components were arranged in a straight line rather than the traditional circular configuration—a bold technical and aesthetic statement.</p>
        <p>The Golden Bridge became Corum's horological masterpiece, demonstrating that they could innovate at the highest levels of watchmaking. It remains one of the most distinctive movements in the industry.</p>
        
        <h2>Admiral's Cup</h2>
        <p>The Admiral's Cup, introduced in 1960, drew inspiration from maritime tradition. Featuring a distinctive twelve-sided case and nautical flag hour markers, the Admiral's Cup connected to yacht racing culture and became Corum's flagship sports collection.</p>
        <p>The collection expanded over decades to include chronographs, tourbillons, and various complications, always maintaining its nautical character and distinctive case shape.</p>
        
        <h2>Bubble Watch</h2>
        <p>The Bubble, introduced in 2000, featured an extremely domed sapphire crystal that created a distinctive spherical profile. This playful design attracted younger collectors and demonstrated Corum's willingness to embrace unconventional aesthetics.</p>
        
        <h2>Artisan Watches</h2>
        <p>Corum has produced numerous artistic timepieces featuring enamel work, engraving, and precious materials. Their willingness to treat watches as canvases for artistic expression distinguishes them from more conservative manufacturers.</p>
        
        <h2>Ownership Changes</h2>
        <p>Corum has undergone several ownership transitions, eventually becoming part of the Citychamp Watch & Jewellery Group. Through these changes, the brand has maintained its creative identity and continued producing distinctive timepieces.</p>
        
        <h2>Heritage Collection</h2>
        <p>Modern Corum offerings include heritage pieces that honor classic designs alongside contemporary interpretations. The brand continues to produce Coin Watches, Golden Bridge models, and Admiral's Cup variations.</p>
        
        <h2>Corum Today</h2>
        <p>Corum remains committed to unconventional watchmaking. For collectors who want something genuinely different—watches that challenge expectations and prioritize creativity over conformity—Corum offers alternatives to mainstream Swiss watchmaking.</p>
