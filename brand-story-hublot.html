        <h1>The History of Hublot</h1>
        <p class="meta">January 2025 · 8 min read</p>

        <p class="intro">The Art of Fusion. Hublot dared to combine gold with rubber when the industry said it couldn't be done. Four decades later, they continue breaking conventions and creating icons for those who dare to be different.</p>

        <h2>Carlo Crocco's Vision</h2>
        <p>In 1980, Italian entrepreneur Carlo Crocco founded Hublot in Nyon, Switzerland, with a revolutionary idea: combine a precious gold case with a natural rubber strap. The name "Hublot"—French for "porthole"—described the distinctive case design with its screws visible on the bezel.</p>
        <p>The Swiss watch establishment was skeptical. Gold and rubber? It seemed like mixing oil and water. But Crocco persisted, and by the mid-1980s, his watches had found an audience among European royalty and celebrities who appreciated their bold, unconventional style.</p>

        <h2>The Art of Fusion</h2>
        <p>Crocco's concept was simple but revolutionary: fuse unexpected materials to create something new. This "Art of Fusion" would become Hublot's guiding philosophy, but it wouldn't reach its full expression until a new leader arrived.</p>
        <p>By the early 2000s, despite its cult following, Hublot remained a small player in the luxury watch market. The brand needed transformation.</p>

        <h2>Jean-Claude Biver Revolution</h2>
        <p>In 2004, Jean-Claude Biver—the legendary watch executive who had revived Blancpain and transformed Omega—became Hublot's CEO. His impact was immediate and dramatic.</p>
        <p>Biver took Crocco's fusion concept and amplified it exponentially. He understood that in a crowded luxury market, Hublot needed to be impossible to ignore. Subtlety was not on the agenda.</p>

        <h2>The Big Bang</h2>
        <p>In 2005, Hublot unveiled the Big Bang—and nothing would be the same. The watch combined multiple materials in a single timepiece: ceramic, titanium, rubber, and gold. The design was aggressive, architectural, and utterly distinctive.</p>
        <p>Critics called it excessive. Buyers couldn't get enough. The Big Bang became an instant icon, propelling Hublot from niche curiosity to major luxury player. Sales exploded, and the brand's visibility soared.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Key Collections</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Big Bang:</strong> The iconic 2005 design that changed everything</li>
                <li><strong>Classic Fusion:</strong> Refined elegance with Hublot DNA</li>
                <li><strong>Spirit of Big Bang:</strong> Tonneau-shaped evolution</li>
                <li><strong>Square Bang:</strong> Geometric bold statement</li>
                <li><strong>MP Collection:</strong> Masterpiece haute horlogerie</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Material Innovation</h2>
        <p>Hublot's fusion philosophy extended beyond aesthetics to material science. The brand invested heavily in developing proprietary materials that no other watchmaker had used.</p>
        <p>Magic Gold, introduced in 2012, combined gold with ceramic to create an 18-karat gold alloy that is virtually scratch-proof. King Gold is a proprietary rose gold alloy with more red tone and greater resistance to fading. Texalium, carbon fiber, sapphire crystal cases—Hublot pushed every boundary.</p>
        <p>The brand even developed colored ceramics in vibrant blues, greens, and reds—colors thought impossible in ceramic until Hublot's materials scientists proved otherwise.</p>

        <h2>In-House Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>Under Biver's leadership, Hublot also invested in becoming a true manufacture. The Unico movement, introduced in 2010, was developed entirely in-house and became the beating heart of the Big Bang line. It featured a flyback chronograph with the unusual detail of having the chronograph mechanism visible from the dial side.</p>
        <p>The MP (Masterpiece) collection pushed further into haute horlogerie territory. The MP-05 LaFerrari, with its 50-day power reserve from 11 mainspring barrels and vertical tourbillon, demonstrated that Hublot could compete at the highest levels of watchmaking complexity.</p>

        <h2>Sports and Partnerships</h2>
        <p>Biver understood the power of sports marketing. Under his direction, Hublot became the official timekeeper of FIFA World Cup, partnering with the world's most-watched sporting event. The brand also formed relationships with Ferrari, Manchester United, and numerous individual athletes.</p>
        <p>These weren't just sponsorships—they were collaborations. Limited editions for each partner featured unique designs and materials, creating collectible pieces that sold out instantly and appreciated in value.</p>

        <h2>LVMH Era</h2>
        <p>In 2008, LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) acquired Hublot, adding it to their watch portfolio alongside TAG Heuer and Zenith. The luxury conglomerate's resources allowed Hublot to expand production capacity while maintaining quality and exclusivity.</p>
        <p>Biver was named president of LVMH's watch division, spreading his influence across the group's brands while continuing to guide Hublot's creative direction until his retirement in 2018.</p>

        <h2>Bold By Design</h2>
        <p>Today, Hublot continues to embody its founder's spirit of fusion and its CEO's vision of bold innovation. Under current CEO Ricardo Guadalupe, the brand has maintained its distinctive identity while expanding its range from accessible entry points to six-figure complications.</p>
        <p>Love them or hate them—and many people feel strongly either way—Hublot watches are impossible to ignore. In a world of understated luxury, they chose to be loud. In an industry that worshipped tradition, they celebrated disruption. The Art of Fusion isn't just about materials; it's about fusing tradition with provocation, heritage with innovation, watchmaking with showmanship.</p>
        <p>Four decades after Carlo Crocco dared to put rubber on gold, Hublot continues to dare. And that, ultimately, is their legacy.</p>
