        <p class="lead-paragraph">The Glycine Airman was the first watch with a 24-hour dial designed specifically for pilots crossing multiple time zones. Worn by military aviators, astronauts, and airline pilots, the Airman became a legend of aviation timekeeping.</p>
        
        <h2>Bienne Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Glycine was founded in 1914 in Bienne, Switzerland, in the heart of Swiss watchmaking country. The company initially focused on producing quality timepieces for the general market, building expertise in movement design and case construction.</p>
        <p>Through the early decades, Glycine established itself as a reliable Swiss manufacturer, though not yet distinguished from numerous competitors in the region.</p>
        
        <h2>The Airman Revolution</h2>
        <p>Everything changed in 1953 when Glycine introduced the Airman. This wasn't merely a pilot watch—it was the first wristwatch with a true 24-hour dial, designed specifically for aviators who needed to track time across multiple zones.</p>
        <p>The Airman's 24-hour scale prevented the AM/PM confusion that could prove dangerous in aviation. A pilot crossing time zones could instantly see actual time without mental calculations that could lead to errors during demanding flights.</p>
        
        <h2>Military and Aviation Adoption</h2>
        <p>The Airman quickly found favor with military pilots. During the Vietnam War, American pilots extensively wore Airman watches, appreciating their legibility and practical 24-hour display. The watch became standard unofficial equipment for many squadrons.</p>
        <p>Commercial airline pilots also adopted the Airman, finding its multiple-timezone capability essential for international routes. The watch earned its reputation where it mattered—on actual wrists in actual cockpits.</p>
        
        <h2>Space Heritage</h2>
        <p>Glycine Airman watches went to space with astronauts who appreciated their aviation-proven functionality. While not part of official NASA equipment, Airman watches traveled aboard numerous missions as personal items chosen by space travelers.</p>
        
        <h2>The 24-Hour Advantage</h2>
        <p>The Airman's 24-hour display offers genuine practical advantages. The hour hand makes one complete revolution per day rather than two, allowing pilots to distinguish morning from afternoon at a glance. Combined with the rotating bezel, tracking multiple time zones becomes intuitive.</p>
        <p>This isn't a gimmick—it's a functional design solution that aviators have relied upon for seven decades.</p>
        
        <h2>Combat Sub</h2>
        <p>Beyond aviation, Glycine developed the Combat Sub for underwater use. These dive watches brought Glycine quality to a different professional market, offering robust construction and serious water resistance for actual divers.</p>
        
        <h2>Invicta Acquisition</h2>
        <p>In 2016, Glycine was acquired by Invicta Watch Group. While this raised concerns among enthusiasts about the brand's future direction, Glycine has maintained its Swiss manufacturing base and continued producing Airman watches true to the original concept.</p>
        
        <h2>Modern Airman Collection</h2>
        <p>Today's Airman collection spans numerous variations—different sizes, dial colors, and complications—but all maintain the essential 24-hour format that defined the original. Purist editions recreate vintage aesthetics, while modern interpretations add contemporary features.</p>
        
        <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
        <p>Glycine offers genuine Swiss pilot watches with documented aviation heritage at prices below many competitors trading on similar credentials. The Airman's practical design and military pedigree provide substance behind the styling.</p>
        
        <h2>Glycine Today</h2>
        <p>Glycine continues producing watches in Switzerland, with the Airman remaining the flagship collection. For pilots, travelers, and enthusiasts who appreciate functional design with real aviation heritage, Glycine offers authentic pilot watches that have earned their reputation in actual cockpits worldwide.</p>
