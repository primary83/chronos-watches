        <section id="pilot-watch-requirements">
            <h2>What Makes a True Pilot's Watch?</h2>

            <h3>Legibility Above All</h3>
            <p>Cockpit conditions demand instant time reading without hesitation. High-contrast dials, large numerals, and prominent hands aren't stylistic choices—they're safety requirements. Pilots glancing from instruments need immediate time recognition, often in challenging lighting from harsh sun glare to dim red cockpit lighting during night operations.</p>

            <h3>Anti-Magnetic Properties</h3>
            <p>Aircraft generate significant electromagnetic fields from avionics, navigation systems, and electrical components. Watches without adequate magnetic resistance can gain or lose significant time when exposed to these fields. Modern pilot watches increasingly incorporate silicon components and anti-magnetic alloys to maintain accuracy in electromagnetically hostile environments.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Size</h3>
            <p>Contrary to the oversized trend in consumer watches, professional pilots often prefer moderate case sizes. Watches must fit comfortably under flight suit cuffs and avoid snagging on cockpit controls. Cases between 40-44mm typically provide the best balance between legibility and practical wearability.</p>

            <h3>Reliable Movement</h3>
            <p>Mechanical movements remain preferred among many pilots for their independence from batteries and electronic components. A mechanical watch continues functioning regardless of electrical system failures. However, high-accuracy quartz movements also have advocates, particularly for their superior precision during long-haul operations.</p>

            <h3>GMT/Dual Time Zone Capability</h3>
            <p>Pilots regularly cross time zones and must track multiple times simultaneously—departure time, destination time, and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC/Zulu time) for air traffic control communications. GMT complications or world time functions address this operational requirement directly.</p>
