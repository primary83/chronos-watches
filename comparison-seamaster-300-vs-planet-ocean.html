        <section id="introduction">
            <p>Omega offers two distinct approaches to dive watches within the Seamaster family. The Seamaster 300 channels 1957 heritage with vintage-inspired aesthetics, while the Planet Ocean embraces modern tool-watch capability with aggressive specifications. Both deliver Omega's Co-Axial Master Chronometer excellence—the choice depends on aesthetic preference and intended use.</p>

            <h2>Omega Seamaster 300</h2>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> $6,300 - $7,400 | <strong>Case Size:</strong> 41mm | <strong>Water Resistance:</strong> 300m</p>
            <p>The Seamaster 300 recreates the aesthetic of Omega's original 1957 dive watch—the same model that equipped early James Bond films. The sandwich dial construction, broad arrow hands, and vintage-style lume plots create period-correct character. The modern Co-Axial 8912 caliber ensures contemporary performance beneath heritage styling.</p>
            <p>The 41mm case wears elegantly, suitable for both dive adventures and formal occasions. The ceramic bezel with Liquidmetal markings provides durability without compromising vintage aesthetics.</p>

            <p>The Planet Ocean embraces modern dive-watch capability without vintage pretense. The 600m water resistance doubles the Seamaster 300's rating. Helium escape valve enables saturation diving. The larger case and bolder design signal serious tool-watch intent.</p>
            <p>Master Chronometer certification ensures accuracy within 0-5 seconds daily and magnetic resistance to 15,000 gauss. The robust construction handles professional underwater use confidently.</p>
