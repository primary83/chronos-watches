        <p style="color: var(--silver);">Since 1926 — Born to Dare</p>
    </section>

    <article class="content">
        <p>Tudor has emerged from Rolex's shadow to become one of the most exciting watch brands of the past decade. What began as Rolex's affordable alternative has evolved into a collector favorite in its own right—offering genuine military heritage, innovative materials, and in-house movements at prices far below the parent brand.</p>

        <h2>The Rolex Connection (1926)</h2>
        <p>Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, registered the Tudor name in 1926. His vision was clear: offer Rolex quality and reliability at more accessible prices. Tudor watches used Rolex cases and crowns but with less expensive movements from trusted Swiss suppliers like ETA.</p>
        <p>For decades, Tudor operated as Rolex's sensible sibling—same build quality, different components, lower price. Early Tudor watches even bore the Rolex crown logo on their dials. The relationship was open: Tudor was Rolex, just more affordable.</p>

        <h2>Military Adoption</h2>
        <p>Tudor's reputation was built not in jewelry stores but on military wrists. The French Marine Nationale adopted Tudor dive watches in the 1950s, finding them as reliable as the more expensive Rolex Submariner. The U.S. Navy tested Tudor Submariners alongside Rolex models. Both passed.</p>
        <p>These weren't ceremonial partnerships—Tudor watches went on actual combat deployments. The MN (Marine Nationale) engravings on vintage Tudor dive watches are authentic military issue, not marketing exercises. This heritage gives Tudor a credibility that money can't buy.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>The "Snowflake" Hands:</strong> Tudor developed distinctive square-tipped hour hands—nicknamed "snowflake" by collectors—for better underwater legibility. Originally a functional choice, these hands became a beloved Tudor signature that the brand has revived in modern collections.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Dark Years</h2>
        <p>From the 1990s through the early 2000s, Tudor lost its way. The brand shifted to smaller cases, quartz movements, and designs that chased fashion rather than heritage. Tudor was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2004. It seemed destined to fade into history.</p>

        <h2>The Black Bay Revival (2012)</h2>
        <p>Everything changed with the Black Bay in 2012. The watch combined Tudor's vintage dive watch aesthetics—the "big crown" from the 1950s, the snowflake hands, the domed crystal—with modern specifications. Collectors went crazy. Waiting lists formed.</p>
        <p>The Black Bay wasn't just nostalgia. It was a coherent design that honored heritage while functioning as a modern tool watch. At roughly one-third the price of a Rolex Submariner, it offered comparable quality and genuinely interesting design.</p>

        <h2>In-House Movements</h2>
        <p>In 2015, Tudor introduced its first in-house movement, the MT5612, in the North Flag. This was significant: Tudor was no longer just using Rolex cases with third-party movements. The MT5612 featured a 70-hour power reserve and COSC certification. Tudor had grown up.</p>
        <p>Today, most Tudor watches use in-house movements. The MT5602 (time-only), MT5612 (date), and MT5813 (chronograph, developed with Breitling) prove Tudor is a serious manufacture, not just a Rolex diffusion line.</p>

        <h2>The Current Collection</h2>
        <p>Tudor's lineup has expanded dramatically:</p>
        <p><strong>Black Bay:</strong> The core collection, available in multiple sizes, colors, and configurations<br>
        <strong>Black Bay Pro:</strong> GMT watch inspired by vintage Tudor explorers<br>
        <strong>Black Bay Chrono:</strong> Racing chronograph with Breitling-developed movement<br>
        <strong>Pelagos:</strong> Professional dive watch with titanium case and helium escape valve<br>
        <strong>Royal:</strong> Integrated-bracelet sports watch<br>
        <strong>1926:</strong> Elegant dress watch line</p>

        <h2>Today's Tudor</h2>
        <p>Tudor has achieved something remarkable: it's escaped the "poor man's Rolex" label to become desirable in its own right. Collectors seek out Tudor specifically—not as a Rolex substitute, but because they want a Tudor. The military heritage, the distinctive design choices, the in-house movements, and the value proposition have created a brand identity separate from the parent company.</p>
        <p>"Born to Dare" isn't just a slogan. From military divers to Antarctic explorers, Tudor has earned its place alongside the most respected tool watch brands in the world.</p>
