    <article class="article-content">
        <p class="lead-paragraph">Garmin didn't start as a watch company—they pioneered GPS navigation. But their technology expertise made them the dominant force in sports and outdoor watches, serving everyone from ultramarathoners to weekend hikers with purpose-built tools that happen to tell time.</p>
        
        <h2>GPS Pioneers</h2>
        <p>Gary Burrell and Min Kao founded Garmin (a portmanteau of their first names) in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas. Their mission: bring GPS technology to consumers. Early products served aviation and marine markets, where accurate positioning was critical.</p>
        <p>As GPS technology miniaturized, Garmin expanded into automotive navigation, handheld devices, and eventually wearables.</p>
        
        <h2>The Forerunner Revolution</h2>
        <p>In 2003, Garmin introduced the Forerunner 201—one of the first GPS-enabled sports watches. Runners could finally track pace, distance, and routes without wheel sensors or estimation. The watch was bulky by today's standards, but it changed running.</p>
        <p>Subsequent Forerunner models improved size, battery life, and features. The line became synonymous with serious running.</p>
        
        <h2>Fenix: The Outdoor Flagship</h2>
        <p>The Fenix line, launched in 2012, targeted outdoor adventurers—hikers, climbers, backcountry skiers. These rugged watches combined GPS navigation, altimeter, barometer, and compass (ABC functions) with multi-sport tracking. Fenix became Garmin's premium outdoor line.</p>
        <p>Modern Fenix watches include solar charging, detailed topographic maps, and weeks of battery life. Serious adventurers often consider them essential equipment.</p>
        
        <h2>Multi-Sport Dominance</h2>
        <p>Triathletes embraced Garmin for seamless swim/bike/run tracking. The watches could switch activities mid-event, track pool laps or open water swimming, measure cycling power (with compatible sensors), and provide running dynamics. No competitor matched this integration.</p>
        
        <h2>Instinct: Rugged Simplicity</h2>
        <p>The Instinct line offered Fenix-like durability and outdoor features in a simpler, more affordable package. Military-standard toughness, long battery life, and straightforward interface attracted outdoor workers and budget-conscious adventurers.</p>
        
        <h2>Venu: Lifestyle Focus</h2>
        <p>The Venu series brought AMOLED displays and lifestyle features to Garmin's lineup. Recognizing that not all customers wanted tactical tool watches, Venu offered Garmin's fitness tracking in more attractive, everyday-appropriate designs.</p>
        
        <h2>Health Metrics</h2>
        <p>Modern Garmin watches track heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, sleep, body battery, and more. The company developed algorithms interpreting this data into actionable insights. Training status, recovery time, and performance predictions help athletes optimize their efforts.</p>
        
        <h2>Connect IQ Platform</h2>
        <p>Garmin's Connect IQ platform allows third-party apps, watch faces, and data fields. This ecosystem approach keeps users engaged and extends watch functionality beyond Garmin's own development.</p>
        
        <h2>Solar Charging</h2>
        <p>Power Glass solar charging technology, introduced in recent Fenix and Instinct models, extends battery life significantly when exposed to sunlight. For extended backcountry trips, solar charging can eliminate battery anxiety entirely.</p>
        
        <h2>Aviation and Specialized Markets</h2>
        <p>Garmin's aviation roots remain strong. The D2 pilot watches include flight logging, airport databases, and navigation features. Similarly, marine-focused watches serve sailors and boaters with tide data and sailing features.</p>
        
        <h2>Competitive Landscape</h2>
        <p>Apple Watch dominates general smartwatch market share, but Garmin owns serious fitness. Runners, cyclists, triathletes, and outdoor enthusiasts overwhelmingly choose Garmin for training tools. This specialization provides defensible market position even against Apple's ecosystem advantages.</p>
        
        <h2>Garmin Today</h2>
        <p>Garmin continues expanding watch lines while maintaining core expertise in GPS and fitness metrics. For athletes and adventurers wanting data-rich tools built for performance rather than general smartwatch features, Garmin remains the standard against which others are measured.</p>
