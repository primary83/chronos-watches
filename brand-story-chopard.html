        <h1>The History of Chopard</h1>
        <p class="meta">January 2025 · 9 min read</p>

        <p class="intro">Where Swiss watchmaking meets high jewelry. A family-owned maison creating joyful luxury since 1860. From precision timepieces to dancing diamonds, Chopard celebrates life's precious moments.</p>

        <h2>Louis-Ulysse Chopard's Beginning</h2>
        <p>In 1860, 24-year-old Louis-Ulysse Chopard established his watchmaking workshop in Sonvilier, in the Swiss Jura mountains. His pocket watches quickly gained recognition for their precision and reliability, attracting customers from across Europe and even Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.</p>
        <p>The company grew steadily, relocating to Geneva in 1937 to be closer to its international clientele. However, by the early 1960s, the Chopard family found itself without a successor willing to continue the business.</p>

        <h2>The Scheufele Era</h2>
        <p>In 1963, Karl Scheufele, a German watchmaker and jeweler from Pforzheim, acquired Chopard. This began a new chapter that would transform the company from a respected watchmaker into a global luxury house encompassing both watches and high jewelry.</p>
        <p>Under Scheufele family leadership—now in its third generation with Karl-Friedrich and Caroline Scheufele—Chopard has remained fiercely independent while growing into one of the world's largest family-owned luxury watch and jewelry manufacturers.</p>

        <h2>Happy Diamonds Revolution</h2>
        <p>In 1976, Ronald Kurowski, a young designer at Chopard, had a revolutionary idea: what if diamonds could move freely inside a watch? He was inspired by a waterfall, where individual droplets catch the light as they dance and sparkle.</p>
        <p>The result was Happy Diamonds—watches featuring freely moving diamonds that dance between two sapphire crystals. The concept was radical: diamonds had always been set rigidly. Letting them move seemed almost reckless. But the effect was magical, and Happy Diamonds became Chopard's most iconic innovation.</p>

            <h4>Key Collections</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alpine Eagle:</strong> Modern luxury sports watch in Lucent Steel</li>
                <li><strong>L.U.C:</strong> Haute horlogerie with Geneva Seal certification</li>
                <li><strong>Happy Sport:</strong> The original moving diamonds sports watch</li>
                <li><strong>Happy Diamonds:</strong> High jewelry with dancing diamonds</li>
                <li><strong>Mille Miglia:</strong> Racing heritage and chronographs</li>
                <li><strong>Imperiale:</strong> Roman-inspired classical elegance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>L.U.C Manufacture</h2>
        <p>In 1996, Chopard took a bold step: establishing their own movement manufacture in Fleurier. Named L.U.C in honor of founder Louis-Ulysse Chopard, this atelier would produce movements to the highest Swiss standards.</p>
        <p>The first L.U.C movement, caliber 96.01, debuted in 1997. It featured a micro-rotor design allowing an ultra-thin case while maintaining COSC chronometer certification. Many L.U.C movements also carry the prestigious Poinçon de Genève (Geneva Seal), certifying exceptional finishing and craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>Today, L.U.C produces everything from simple time-only movements to grand complications including minute repeaters, tourbillons, and perpetual calendars—all developed and manufactured in-house.</p>

        <h2>The St. Moritz Revival</h2>
        <p>In 1980, Karl-Friedrich Scheufele designed the St. Moritz—a luxury sports watch with an integrated bracelet, entering the same arena as the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and Patek Philippe Nautilus. The watch was ahead of its time but never achieved the same cult status.</p>
        <p>In 2019, Karl-Friedrich revisited this design with his son Karl-Fritz. The result was the Alpine Eagle—a thoroughly modern reinterpretation featuring Lucent Steel A223, a proprietary alloy that is harder, more scratch-resistant, and more luminous than standard stainless steel.</p>

        <h2>Mille Miglia Partnership</h2>
        <p>Since 1988, Chopard has been the official timing partner of the Mille Miglia, the legendary Italian road race for classic cars. This partnership has produced a series of sporty chronographs and time-only watches that capture the spirit of vintage motorsport.</p>
        <p>Each year, Chopard releases limited editions celebrating the race, featuring design elements inspired by classic automobiles—from tire-tread rubber straps to dashboard-inspired dials.</p>

        <h2>Commitment to Sustainability</h2>
        <p>In 2013, Chopard embarked on "The Journey to Sustainable Luxury." This comprehensive initiative addresses every aspect of their supply chain, from sourcing to production.</p>
        <p>By 2018, Chopard committed to using 100% ethical gold in all their watch and jewelry production. They source gold from artisanal mines certified by the Swiss Better Gold Association and Fairmined organizations, ensuring both environmental responsibility and fair labor practices.</p>

        <h2>Cannes and Celebrity</h2>
        <p>Since 1998, Chopard has been the official partner of the Cannes Film Festival, creating the Palme d'Or trophy awarded to the best film. This partnership has made Chopard synonymous with red carpet glamour, with celebrities regularly choosing their pieces for premieres and award ceremonies.</p>
        <p>The Red Carpet Collection, launched annually at Cannes, features one-of-a-kind high jewelry pieces that demonstrate Chopard's mastery of precious gems and innovative design.</p>

        <h2>Family Values</h2>
        <p>Today, Chopard remains one of the few major luxury houses still independently owned and operated by the founding family. This independence allows them to take a long-term view, investing in craftsmanship and sustainability rather than quarterly results.</p>
        <p>With Karl-Friedrich Scheufele as co-president overseeing watches and Caroline Scheufele as co-president overseeing jewelry and creative direction, Chopard continues to blend Swiss precision with joyful creativity—proving that luxury can be both responsible and delightful.</p>
