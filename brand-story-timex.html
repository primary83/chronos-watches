    <article class="article-content">
        <p class="lead-paragraph">"Takes a licking and keeps on ticking." For over 170 years, Timex has put affordable, durable watches on American wrists. From Civil War soldiers to modern marathoners, Timex democratized timekeeping and proved that quality doesn't require luxury prices.</p>
        
        <h2>Waterbury Beginnings</h2>
        <p>The story begins in 1854 in Waterbury, Connecticut, when the Waterbury Clock Company started making affordable brass clocks. In 1880, they expanded into pocket watches with a revolutionary goal: make watches so affordable that everyone could own one.</p>
        <p>The Waterbury watch cost just $3.50—a fraction of Swiss competitors. It wasn't fancy, but it worked. The company sold millions, proving mass-market watchmaking viable.</p>
        
        <h2>Becoming Timex</h2>
        <p>Through various mergers and name changes, the company became US Time Corporation after World War II. In 1950, they introduced the Timex brand name. The new identity came with a new mission: create virtually indestructible watches for ordinary people.</p>
        
        <h2>Takes a Licking</h2>
        <p>In the 1950s-60s, Timex launched one of advertising's most memorable campaigns. Spokesman John Cameron Swayze subjected Timex watches to torture tests on live television—strapping them to boat propellers, dropping them from cliffs, putting them through washing machines. Each time: "Takes a licking and keeps on ticking."</p>
        <p>The campaign ran for decades and established Timex's identity: affordable durability. Swiss luxury couldn't compete on price; Timex didn't try to compete on prestige.</p>
        
        <h2>The Quartz Revolution</h2>
        <p>When quartz movements threatened Swiss mechanical watchmaking in the 1970s, Timex adapted quickly. Their affordable quartz watches offered accuracy previously available only at premium prices. While Swiss brands struggled, Timex thrived.</p>
        
        <h2>Ironman: Defining Sports Watches</h2>
        <p>In 1986, Timex partnered with the Ironman Triathlon to create the Ironman watch. Featuring a digital display, lap timer, and water resistance, it became the best-selling watch in America. Runners, triathletes, and fitness enthusiasts made Ironman their go-to sports watch.</p>
        <p>The Ironman remains in production today, with over 90 million sold. Its DNA appears in countless sports watches from other brands.</p>
        
        <h2>Indiglo: Lighting the Way</h2>
        <p>In 1992, Timex introduced Indiglo—electroluminescent backlighting that illuminated the entire dial with a distinctive blue-green glow. Simple, elegant, and immediately useful, Indiglo became a Timex signature. Competitors scrambled to match it.</p>
        <p>Indiglo proved that innovation could come from unexpected places. A budget brand created technology that premium brands couldn't ignore.</p>
        
        <h2>The Weekender Phenomenon</h2>
        <p>The Timex Weekender, with its easily changeable NATO-style straps, became a style icon. Fashion blogs and affordable-fashion communities embraced it as proof that good design doesn't require big budgets. At roughly $30, the Weekender offered customization and classic aesthetics.</p>
        
        <h2>Collaboration Strategy</h2>
        <p>Modern Timex has embraced collaborations with fashion brands, designers, and cultural institutions. Partnerships with Todd Snyder, Engineered Garments, and others have elevated Timex's fashion credibility while maintaining accessible prices.</p>
        <p>The Todd Snyder collaborations, in particular, proved that Timex's heritage designs could compete aesthetically with watches costing ten times more.</p>
        
        <h2>Marlin Revival</h2>
        <p>Timex reissued the Marlin—a 1960s mechanical dress watch—to surprising success. At roughly $200 for an automatic movement, it offered entry-level mechanical watchmaking. Enthusiasts appreciated the heritage connection; newcomers got affordable automatic watches.</p>
        
        <h2>Q Timex Reissues</h2>
        <p>The Q Timex reissued 1970s quartz designs that had become vintage collector pieces. Rotating bezels, retro aesthetics, and distinctive "Q" branding attracted both nostalgic buyers and young collectors discovering vintage styles.</p>
        
        <h2>American Identity</h2>
        <p>Though now owned by various investment groups and manufacturing globally, Timex maintains strong American identity. The brand represents a particular American value: democratic access to quality goods. A Timex tells time as accurately as a Rolex at a fraction of the cost.</p>
        
        <h2>Timex Today</h2>
        <p>Timex continues offering watches from under $50 to several hundred dollars. The Ironman serves athletes; the Weekender serves style-conscious shoppers; the Marlin serves mechanical watch newcomers; the Expedition serves outdoor enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>For first watches, beater watches, gym watches, or simply honest daily wearers, Timex remains the accessible American icon it's been for generations.</p>
