        <p class="lead-paragraph">A single dot at 12 o'clock, representing the sun at high noon. No other markers. This radical minimalism made Movado's Museum dial one of the most recognized watch designs in history—and the only watch dial in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        
        <h2>La Chaux-de-Fonds Origins</h2>
        <p>Movado was founded in 1881 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, by Achille Ditesheim, who was just 19 years old. The company was initially called LAI Ditesheim & Frères, operated by Achille and his five brothers. In 1905, they renamed the company Movado, from the Esperanto word meaning "always in motion."</p>
        <p>The choice of Esperanto—a constructed international language—reflected the brothers' global ambitions for their watch company.</p>
        
        <h2>Early Innovation</h2>
        <p>Movado quickly established itself as an innovator. In 1912, they introduced the Polyplan, a watch with a curved movement designed to follow the natural curve of the wrist. This wasn't simply a curved case—the movement itself was engineered in three planes, a remarkable technical achievement.</p>
        <p>The Ermeto, introduced in 1926, was a self-winding pocket watch with a sliding case—opening and closing the case wound the mainspring. It became a design classic and demonstrated Movado's willingness to think differently.</p>
        
        <h2>The Museum Watch: Art Meets Time</h2>
        <p>In 1947, American designer Nathan George Horwitt created a dial that would change Movado's destiny. Inspired by the Bauhaus principle that form should follow function, Horwitt reasoned that since we tell time by the position of hands, not by reading numbers, why include numbers at all?</p>
        <p>His design featured a plain dial with a single gold dot at 12 o'clock, representing the sun at high noon. The hands—and the viewer's understanding of a clock face—did the rest. Movado eventually produced this design, and in 1960, it became the first watch dial to enter the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>
        
        <h2>The Museum Dial Legacy</h2>
        <p>The Museum dial transformed Movado's identity. What had been a respected but conventional Swiss watch company became synonymous with modernist design. The single-dot dial appeared on countless variations—different sizes, materials, and complications—but always maintained its essential minimalism.</p>
        <p>For many buyers, particularly in America, Movado became their introduction to Swiss watches precisely because the Museum dial was so distinctive and recognizable.</p>
        
        <h2>American Success</h2>
        <p>Movado found particular success in the American market, where the Museum dial's clean modernism resonated with consumers seeking distinctive design. The brand became a staple of upscale department stores and a popular gift choice for graduations and milestones.</p>
        
        <h2>Movado Group</h2>
        <p>Today, Movado Group Inc. is headquartered in New Jersey and owns multiple watch brands including Ebel, Concord, and licenses for fashion brands like Coach, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss, and Lacoste. This diversification has made Movado a significant player in the accessible luxury and fashion watch segments.</p>
        
        <h2>Bold Collection</h2>
        <p>The Bold collection brought the Museum dial aesthetic to a younger audience with larger cases, colorful finishes, and more contemporary styling. These watches maintained the signature dot while appealing to fashion-conscious buyers who wanted something more statement-making.</p>
        
        <h2>Heritage and Modern</h2>
        <p>Movado has also revisited its pre-Museum heritage, reissuing designs like the Polyplan and creating collections that honor the brand's century-plus history. These pieces remind collectors that Movado's design innovation predates the famous dot.</p>
        
        <h2>Movado Today</h2>
        <p>Movado occupies a unique position: a Swiss heritage brand known primarily for a single, iconic design. While some collectors view this narrow identity as limiting, others appreciate that Movado has remained true to its modernist principles. That single dot continues to represent something powerful—that sometimes, less really is more.</p>
