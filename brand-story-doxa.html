        <p class="lead-paragraph">That brilliant orange dial wasn't a design choice—it was a safety innovation. Doxa created the first purpose-built recreational dive watch, and that distinctive color provided crucial underwater visibility that saved lives.</p>
        
        <h2>Le Locle Foundation</h2>
        <p>Doxa was founded in 1889 by Georges Ducommun in Le Locle, Switzerland. The name comes from the Greek word for "glory" or "belief," reflecting Ducommun's faith in Swiss watchmaking traditions. For most of its early history, Doxa produced quality timepieces without particular distinction from other Swiss manufacturers.</p>
        <p>This changed dramatically in the late 1960s when Doxa turned its attention to the emerging sport of recreational diving.</p>
        
        <h2>The SUB 300: Revolutionary Dive Watch</h2>
        <p>In 1967, Doxa introduced the SUB 300—the first dive watch designed specifically for recreational divers rather than military or professional use. Developed in collaboration with diving pioneer Claude Wesly and U.S. Divers, the SUB 300 introduced innovations that became industry standards.</p>
        <p>The watch featured a unidirectional bezel with a "no-decompression" dive table, allowing divers to calculate safe dive times directly from their wrist. This practical safety feature distinguished Doxa from competitors focused merely on water resistance depth ratings.</p>
        
        <h2>The Orange Dial</h2>
        <p>Doxa's signature orange dial wasn't chosen for aesthetics—it was chosen for visibility. Research showed orange provided maximum contrast and visibility underwater across varying light conditions and depths. The color could be seen when black, blue, or white dials became difficult to read.</p>
        <p>That orange dial became Doxa's trademark, instantly recognizable and functionally superior. Other manufacturers eventually offered orange dial options, but Doxa pioneered the concept.</p>
        
        <h2>Cousteau Connection</h2>
        <p>Jacques Cousteau, the legendary ocean explorer, equipped his Calypso crew with Doxa SUB watches. This endorsement from diving's most famous figure validated Doxa's claims of professional capability. When Cousteau's team trusted Doxa for actual underwater expeditions, recreational divers took notice.</p>
        
        <h2>U.S. Navy Aqua-Lung Teams</h2>
        <p>Doxa SUB watches were adopted by U.S. Navy Aqua-Lung teams, adding military credibility to the recreational diving credentials. These weren't ceremonial purchases—the watches were used in actual underwater operations by trained military divers.</p>
        
        <h2>Patented Innovations</h2>
        <p>Beyond the bezel dive table, Doxa patented several innovations including a helium escape valve for saturation diving and specific case constructions for pressure resistance. These technical achievements placed Doxa among the serious dive watch manufacturers, not merely fashion brands styled to look like dive watches.</p>
        
        <h2>Quiet Years and Revival</h2>
        <p>Through the 1980s and 1990s, Doxa faded from prominence as the dive watch market evolved and changed hands multiple times. Vintage Doxa SUB watches became collectibles, sought by enthusiasts who appreciated their historical significance and distinctive design.</p>
        <p>In the 2000s, new ownership revived Doxa, reissuing classic designs and introducing new models that honored the SUB heritage while incorporating modern manufacturing standards.</p>
        
        <h2>Modern SUB Collection</h2>
        <p>Today's Doxa SUB collection faithfully recreates the original designs—including that iconic orange dial—with contemporary movements and materials. Various SUB versions offer different depth ratings and color options, but all maintain the essential Doxa character.</p>
        
        <h2>Collector Appeal</h2>
        <p>Doxa has developed a devoted collector following. The brand's authentic diving heritage, distinctive aesthetics, and historical significance create appeal beyond mere specifications. A Doxa represents a piece of diving history that many other brands cannot claim.</p>
        
        <h2>Doxa Today</h2>
        <p>Doxa continues producing dive watches from Switzerland, maintaining their position as one of the original recreational dive watch specialists. For divers and collectors who appreciate historical authenticity and distinctive design, Doxa offers something unique: the watch that created the category, still available, still orange, still purposeful.</p>
