            <h2>Device Overview</h2>

            <h3>Fitbit Sense 2</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> $249 (often discounted to $199) | <strong>Display:</strong> 1.58" AMOLED | <strong>Battery:</strong> 6+ days</p>

            <p>The Fitbit Sense 2 represents Google's (Fitbit's parent company) most advanced health wearable. It includes electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors for stress monitoring, ECG capability for atrial fibrillation detection, skin temperature tracking, and SpO2 blood oxygen measurement. The health-first approach prioritizes comprehensive wellness monitoring over smartwatch features.</p>

            <p>Fitbit Premium subscription ($9.99/month or $79.99/year) unlocks advanced insights, workout programs, and detailed health metrics. While the watch functions without Premium, the full experience requires ongoing subscription—a consideration for long-term ownership cost.</p>

            <h3>Apple Watch SE (2nd Generation)</h3>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> $249 (40mm) / $279 (44mm) | <strong>Display:</strong> 1.57" or 1.78" OLED | <strong>Battery:</strong> 18 hours typical</p>

            <p>The Apple Watch SE delivers core Apple Watch functionality at reduced price by omitting always-on display, blood oxygen sensor, ECG, and temperature sensing. For iPhone users, it provides seamless ecosystem integration—notifications, calls, Apple Pay, and app access that Fitbit cannot match.</p>

            <p>Apple Fitness+ subscription ($9.99/month or $79.99/year) offers workout videos and guided meditations designed for Apple Watch integration. However, the watch provides comprehensive functionality without subscription—a meaningful difference from Fitbit's model.</p>

        <section id="health-tracking">
            <h2>Health Tracking Capabilities</h2>

            <h3>Heart Rate Monitoring</h3>
            <p><strong>Fitbit Sense 2:</strong> Continuous optical heart rate monitoring with irregular rhythm notifications. The ECG app detects atrial fibrillation—FDA-cleared for this specific use. Heart rate data integrates with stress tracking for comprehensive cardiovascular insight. Resting heart rate trends over time help identify fitness improvements or potential health issues.</p>

            <p><strong>Apple Watch SE:</strong> Continuous optical heart rate monitoring with high/low heart rate alerts and irregular rhythm notifications. Lacks ECG capability—the significant health feature omission justifying the SE's lower price versus Series models. However, the irregular rhythm notification algorithm provides meaningful atrial fibrillation screening.</p>

            <p><strong>Winner: Fitbit Sense 2</strong> — ECG capability provides clinical-grade heart rhythm analysis unavailable on the SE.</p>

            <h3>Sleep Tracking</h3>
            <p><strong>Fitbit Sense 2:</strong> Comprehensive sleep tracking including duration, sleep stages (light, deep, REM), sleep score, and skin temperature variation. The 6+ day battery enables continuous wear without charging interruption. Sleep insights improve with Premium subscription, offering personalized recommendations based on accumulated data.</p>

            <p><strong>Apple Watch SE:</strong> Sleep tracking with duration and stages, respiratory rate monitoring during sleep, and sleep scheduling features. The 18-hour battery realistically requires nightly charging, meaning sleep tracking demands charging at alternative times—often during morning routines. This friction reduces sleep tracking consistency for many users.</p>

            <p><strong>Winner: Fitbit Sense 2</strong> — Superior battery life makes continuous sleep tracking practical rather than theoretical.</p>

            <h3>Stress Monitoring</h3>
            <p><strong>Fitbit Sense 2:</strong> Continuous electrodermal activity (EDA) sensing detects stress responses throughout the day, not just during dedicated sessions. The body response metric combines heart rate variability, EDA, skin temperature, and activity to provide stress scores. This passive monitoring captures stress patterns without requiring active engagement.</p>

            <p><strong>Apple Watch SE:</strong> Mindfulness app offers breathing exercises and guided meditations, but lacks physiological stress detection hardware. Users must actively engage with relaxation features rather than receiving passive stress monitoring.</p>

            <p><strong>Winner: Fitbit Sense 2</strong> — Hardware-based stress detection provides insights Apple Watch SE cannot generate.</p>

            <h3>Blood Oxygen and Temperature</h3>
            <p><strong>Fitbit Sense 2:</strong> SpO2 monitoring during sleep tracks blood oxygen saturation variations. Skin temperature sensor detects variations from personal baseline during sleep—useful for menstrual cycle tracking and early illness detection.</p>

            <p><strong>Apple Watch SE:</strong> No blood oxygen sensing or temperature tracking—these features appear only on Apple Watch Series models and Ultra.</p>

            <p><strong>Winner: Fitbit Sense 2</strong> — Both features unavailable on Apple Watch SE.</p>
