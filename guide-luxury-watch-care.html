        <p class="lead-paragraph">A luxury watch represents significant investment—financially and emotionally. Proper care preserves both its function and value. Whether you own a Rolex, Omega, Patek Philippe, or other fine timepiece, these practices protect your investment for generations.</p>
        
        <h2>Daily Wearing Practices</h2>
        <p><strong>Put it on last, take it off first:</strong> Apply cologne, sunscreen, and lotions before wearing your watch. Remove it before showering with soap. Chemicals can degrade gaskets, damage finishes, and contaminate movements over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Avoid impacts:</strong> Despite marketing showing watches in extreme conditions, impacts damage movements. Be aware of doorframes, steering wheels, and hard surfaces. A moment's carelessness can cause expensive damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Crown position:</strong> After setting time or winding, ensure screw-down crowns are fully tightened. This maintains water resistance. Many water damage claims result from users forgetting to secure crowns.</p>
        
        <h2>Water Exposure</h2>
        <p><strong>Know your rating:</strong> Water resistance ratings assume new gaskets and sealed crowns. A 100m-rated watch handles swimming; a 30m-rated watch handles splashes. Respect these limits—water damage voids warranties and causes extensive damage.</p>
        <p><strong>After salt water:</strong> Rinse your watch with fresh water after ocean exposure. Salt is corrosive. Let it dry completely before storage.</p>
        <p><strong>Annual pressure testing:</strong> Gaskets degrade over time. Annual pressure testing—quick and inexpensive—verifies water resistance before problems occur.</p>
        
        <h2>Magnetic Fields</h2>
        <p><strong>Keep away from magnets:</strong> MRI machines, magnetic phone cases, some handbag clasps, and audio speakers contain magnets that can affect accuracy. Modern watches have improved antimagnetic properties, but caution remains wise.</p>
        <p><strong>Demagnetization:</strong> If your watch suddenly loses significant accuracy, magnetization may be the cause. Demagnetization is quick and inexpensive—a watchmaker can do it in minutes.</p>
        
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p><strong>Watch box or case:</strong> Store unworn watches in cushioned boxes or dedicated watch cases. This protects from dust, light, and accidental damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Watch winder debate:</strong> Automatic watches kept on winders remain running, which some argue causes unnecessary wear. Others argue that starting a stopped watch creates more stress than continuous running. Either approach is acceptable; just be consistent.</p>
        <p><strong>Climate control:</strong> Extreme temperatures and humidity damage watches. Store in climate-controlled environments, not attics, basements, or cars.</p>
        
        <h2>Cleaning</h2>
        <p><strong>Regular wiping:</strong> Use a soft microfiber cloth to remove fingerprints and oils after wearing. This simple habit keeps your watch looking its best.</p>
        <p><strong>Deep cleaning bracelets:</strong> Metal bracelets accumulate dirt between links. Gentle cleaning with warm water, mild soap, and a soft brush restores shine. Ensure the watch is water-resistant before getting it wet.</p>
        <p><strong>Avoid chemicals:</strong> Never use household cleaners, solvents, or ultrasonic cleaners meant for jewelry. These can damage finishes and gaskets.</p>
        
        <h2>Leather Strap Care</h2>
        <p><strong>Avoid water:</strong> Leather and water don't mix. Remove leather-strapped watches before swimming, showering, or heavy sweating.</p>
        <p><strong>Rotate straps:</strong> If you wear your watch daily, rotate between two straps. This allows each to dry completely and extends lifespan.</p>
        <p><strong>Condition occasionally:</strong> Quality leather conditioner prevents cracking. Apply sparingly once or twice yearly.</p>
        
        <h2>Service Schedule</h2>
        <p><strong>Follow manufacturer recommendations:</strong> Most luxury brands recommend service every 5-10 years. Don't wait until problems appear—preventive maintenance costs less than emergency repair.</p>
        <p><strong>Use appropriate service:</strong> For valuable luxury watches, authorized service centers provide genuine parts and factory-trained technicians. The cost premium is justified for expensive pieces.</p>
        <p><strong>Keep records:</strong> Document all service in writing. Service history supports resale value and helps future owners maintain the watch properly.</p>
        
        <h2>Insurance and Documentation</h2>
        <p><strong>Insure valuable pieces:</strong> Homeowner's policies often have sublimits for jewelry. Separate watch insurance or scheduled coverage protects against theft, loss, and damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Photograph your collection:</strong> Document serial numbers, conditions, and any distinguishing characteristics. This aids insurance claims and recovery if stolen.</p>
        <p><strong>Secure storage:</strong> For collections of significant value, consider a home safe or safe deposit box for pieces not being worn.</p>
        
        <h2>Travel Considerations</h2>
        <p><strong>Carry-on only:</strong> Never check luxury watches in luggage. Keep them on your wrist or in carry-on bags you control.</p>
        <p><strong>TSA awareness:</strong> Security screening requires removing watches. Don't leave them in bins while dressing. Some travelers remove watches before security and keep them in hand throughout.</p>
        <p><strong>Hotel safes:</strong> Use in-room safes when not wearing valuable watches. Better yet, keep wearing them or bring only watches you're comfortable with losing.</p>
        
        <h2>Long-Term Preservation</h2>
        <p>Luxury watches can last centuries with proper care. The watch you maintain today may serve your grandchildren. Treat it accordingly—with respect for its craftsmanship and awareness that your care today determines its condition tomorrow.</p>
