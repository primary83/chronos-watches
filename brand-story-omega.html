        <h1>Omega</h1>
        <p style="color: var(--silver);">Since 1848 — First Watch on the Moon</p>
    </section>

    <article class="content">
        <p>On July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the lunar surface wearing an Omega Speedmaster—making it the first watch worn on the Moon. This moment crystallized Omega's identity: a brand that combines precision engineering with historic achievement. From timing the Olympics to diving with Jacques Cousteau to equipping James Bond, Omega has woven itself into the fabric of the 20th century.</p>

        <h2>La Chaux-de-Fonds Origins (1848)</h2>
        <p>Louis Brandt began assembling pocket watches in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1848—the same year Switzerland became a federal state. Working from his home, Brandt sourced parts from local craftsmen and assembled them into finished timepieces, which he sold across Europe.</p>
        <p>After Louis's death in 1879, his sons Louis-Paul and César revolutionized the business. They built a modern factory, implemented assembly-line production, and focused on precision. In 1894, they created a revolutionary movement and gave it a name that would define the company: Omega, the last letter of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing ultimate achievement.</p>

        <h2>The Seamaster (1948)</h2>
        <p>To celebrate its centenary, Omega introduced the Seamaster in 1948. Originally designed as an elegant watch with enhanced water resistance (drawing on technology developed for British military watches during WWII), the Seamaster evolved into one of the most versatile watch families ever created.</p>
        <p>The Seamaster 300 (1957) became a professional dive watch. The Planet Ocean pushed depth ratings further. The Aqua Terra offered dressy water resistance. Today, the Seamaster encompasses everything from the urban-ready Aqua Terra to the 6000m-rated Ultra Deep.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>James Bond's Watch:</strong> Since GoldenEye (1995), James Bond has worn Omega Seamasters exclusively. The partnership has spawned numerous limited editions and made the Seamaster synonymous with sophisticated adventure—exactly the brand image Omega cultivated.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Speedmaster and the Moon</h2>
        <p>The Speedmaster, introduced in 1957, was designed as a racing chronograph—hence the tachymeter bezel for calculating speed. But fate had other plans.</p>
        <p>In 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra wore his personal Speedmaster on Mercury-Atlas 8. NASA noticed. In 1965, the agency subjected multiple chronographs to brutal testing: extreme temperatures, vacuum, humidity, shock, and vibration. Only the Speedmaster survived. NASA certified it for all manned space missions.</p>
        <p>On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin wore his Speedmaster during the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Neil Armstrong left his inside the Lunar Module as a backup timing device. The Speedmaster became the "Moonwatch"—a nickname it still carries today.</p>

        <h2>Saving Apollo 13</h2>
        <p>The Speedmaster's finest hour came during disaster. When Apollo 13's service module exploded in 1970, the astronauts lost most of their instruments. During the critical engine burn to return home, Jack Swigert timed 14 seconds on his Speedmaster while Jim Lovell watched the Earth's horizon. The burn was perfect. The Speedmaster received NASA's Silver Snoopy Award—given for contributions to flight safety and mission success.</p>

        <h2>Olympic Timekeeping</h2>
        <p>Omega has served as official Olympic timekeeper more than any other brand, beginning at Los Angeles 1932. The company has introduced numerous innovations: the first photo-finish camera (1948), electronic timing (1952), touchpads for swimming (1968), and the current system capable of measuring to one-millionth of a second.</p>

        <h2>The Co-Axial Revolution</h2>
        <p>In 1999, Omega introduced the Co-Axial escapement—invented by English watchmaker George Daniels. Unlike the traditional lever escapement (unchanged since 1755), the Co-Axial dramatically reduces friction, extending service intervals from 3-5 years to 8-10 years. Combined with the Master Chronometer certification (resistance to 15,000 gauss magnetic fields), Omega movements now represent the cutting edge of mechanical timekeeping.</p>

        <h2>Today's Omega</h2>
        <p>Under Swatch Group ownership since the 1983 merger that saved the Swiss watch industry, Omega has positioned itself just below Rolex in the luxury hierarchy—but with arguably more technical innovation. The Speedmaster remains virtually unchanged since 1969. The Seamaster continues to evolve. The Constellation and De Ville offer elegant dress watches.</p>
        <p>From the Moon to the ocean floor, from the Olympics to the silver screen, Omega has earned its place as one of the world's most storied watchmakers.</p>
