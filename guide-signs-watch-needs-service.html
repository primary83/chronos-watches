        <p class="lead-paragraph">Your watch communicates when something's wrong—if you know what to listen for. Catching problems early prevents expensive damage and keeps your timepiece running for generations. Here are the warning signs every watch owner should recognize.</p>
        
        <h2>Accuracy Problems</h2>
        <p><strong>Gaining or losing significant time:</strong> Mechanical watches should stay within -4 to +6 seconds per day when properly regulated. If your watch suddenly gains or loses minutes per day, the movement needs attention. Gradual degradation over years suggests routine service is due; sudden changes indicate a specific problem.</p>
        <p><strong>Erratic timekeeping:</strong> If your watch keeps perfect time one day and loses minutes the next, something's wrong. Inconsistent performance often indicates worn components, magnetization, or lubrication breakdown.</p>
        
        <h2>Power Reserve Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>Reduced power reserve:</strong> If your automatic watch used to run 40+ hours but now dies after 20, the mainspring or winding mechanism may be failing. Similarly, if a manual-wind watch needs winding more frequently than before, it's time for service.</p>
        <p><strong>Watch stops randomly:</strong> A watch that stops despite adequate winding likely has movement issues. This could range from simple lubrication problems to serious component failure.</p>
        
        <h2>Physical Signs</h2>
        <p><strong>Condensation under the crystal:</strong> Moisture inside your watch is an emergency. Even small amounts of condensation indicate seal failure and can cause rapid corrosion. Stop wearing the watch and seek service immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Crown feels different:</strong> If the crown suddenly feels loose, gritty, or harder to turn than usual, the winding mechanism or crown tube may be damaged. A crown that pulls out unexpectedly indicates worn stem components.</p>
        <p><strong>Rotor sounds wrong:</strong> Automatic watch rotors should spin smoothly and quietly. Grinding, clicking, or excessive noise suggests worn bearings or loose components.</p>
        
        <h2>Visual Indicators</h2>
        <p><strong>Seconds hand stuttering:</strong> A smooth-sweeping seconds hand that begins to stutter or jump indicates power delivery problems. The movement isn't receiving consistent energy from the mainspring.</p>
        <p><strong>Date changes slowly:</strong> If the date used to snap at midnight but now creeps gradually, the calendar mechanism is wearing. This often precedes complete calendar failure.</p>
        <p><strong>Hands misaligned:</strong> If the minute hand doesn't point exactly at 12 when the hour changes, or hands don't align properly at 12:00, the hands may have slipped on their posts—usually from impact.</p>
        
        <h2>Unusual Sounds</h2>
        <p><strong>Ticking sounds different:</strong> You know how your watch normally sounds. Any change—louder ticking, irregular rhythm, or new sounds—warrants investigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Rattling:</strong> Loose components inside the case create rattling sounds. This could be anything from a loose dial screw to a broken component bouncing around—potentially causing more damage.</p>
        
        <h2>Chronograph Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>Pushers feel wrong:</strong> Chronograph pushers should have consistent, defined click points. Mushy, sticky, or inconsistent pushers suggest worn components.</p>
        <p><strong>Chronograph won't reset to zero:</strong> If chronograph hands don't return precisely to zero, they need adjustment—a relatively simple service procedure.</p>
        <p><strong>Sub-dials don't work:</strong> A partially functioning chronograph indicates specific gear train problems requiring professional diagnosis.</p>
        
        <h2>Time Since Last Service</h2>
        <p><strong>More than 5-7 years:</strong> Even without symptoms, mechanical watches need periodic service. Lubricants degrade, gaskets age, and components wear. Manufacturers typically recommend service every 5-10 years depending on the brand and usage.</p>
        <p><strong>Unknown service history:</strong> If you've acquired a watch without service records, have it inspected. Previous owners may have neglected maintenance.</p>
        
        <h2>After Incidents</h2>
        <p><strong>After drops or impacts:</strong> Even if the watch appears fine after a drop, internal damage may exist. Hairsprings bend, jewels crack, and pivots break without external evidence. Have significant impacts checked professionally.</p>
        <p><strong>After water exposure:</strong> If water entered a watch not rated for that exposure—or if you suspect seal failure—immediate professional drying and inspection prevents corrosion damage.</p>
        <p><strong>After magnetic exposure:</strong> Strong magnets (MRI machines, magnetic phone mounts, some handbag clasps) can magnetize the hairspring, causing significant accuracy problems. Demagnetization is quick and inexpensive.</p>
        
        <h2>When in Doubt</h2>
        <p>If something feels wrong, it probably is. Watches are precise instruments—changes in behavior always have causes. Early intervention typically costs less than waiting until problems compound. A good watchmaker can diagnose issues quickly and recommend appropriate action.</p>
