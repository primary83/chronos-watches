        <p class="lead-paragraph">Citizen's mission has always been to create watches for all the citizens of the world. From pioneering light-powered technology to producing movements for countless brands, Citizen has democratized quality watchmaking for over a century.</p>
        
        <h2>Founding Vision: A Watch for Every Citizen</h2>
        <p>The Citizen Watch Company was established in 1930 in Tokyo, Japan, though its roots trace back to 1918 when the Shokosha Watch Research Institute was founded. The name "Citizen" was chosen to reflect the company's ambition: to create watches that would be accessible to citizens everywhere, not just the wealthy elite.</p>
        <p>This democratic philosophy has guided Citizen throughout its history, driving the company to innovate constantly in pursuit of reliable, affordable, and technologically advanced timepieces.</p>
        
        <h2>Post-War Innovation</h2>
        <p>After World War II, Citizen emerged as a leader in Japanese watchmaking. In 1956, the company introduced Japan's first shock-resistant watch, followed by the country's first waterproof watch in 1959. These innovations established Citizen as a serious competitor to Swiss watchmakers.</p>
        <p>The 1960s brought further breakthroughs, including Japan's first electronic watch in 1966. Citizen was positioning itself at the forefront of the technological revolution that would transform the watch industry.</p>
        
        <h2>The Quartz Revolution</h2>
        <p>While Seiko introduced the first commercial quartz watch, Citizen quickly became a major player in quartz technology. In 1976, Citizen unveiled the world's thinnest LCD quartz watch, demonstrating its engineering prowess. The company continued to push boundaries with increasingly thin and accurate quartz movements.</p>
        <p>Citizen's commitment to quartz excellence led to the development of movements that would be used not only in their own watches but supplied to brands worldwide through their Miyota subsidiary.</p>
        
        <h2>Eco-Drive: The Light-Powered Revolution</h2>
        <p>In 1976, Citizen introduced a technology that would become their signature innovation: the light-powered watch, initially called the Crystron Solar Cell. This evolved into what we now know as Eco-Drive, officially launched in 1995.</p>
        <p>Eco-Drive watches convert any light source—natural or artificial—into energy, eliminating the need for battery replacements. A fully charged Eco-Drive watch can run for months in complete darkness. This technology was revolutionary, combining environmental consciousness with practical convenience.</p>
        <p>Today, Eco-Drive remains Citizen's core technology, featured across their entire range from affordable everyday watches to their high-end Chronomaster collection.</p>
        
        <h2>The Chronomaster and High Accuracy</h2>
        <p>Citizen's Chronomaster line represents their pursuit of ultimate precision. The Caliber 0100, introduced in 2019, achieves an astonishing accuracy of ±1 second per year—making it the world's most accurate quartz watch. This movement uses a unique AT-cut crystal oscillating at 8.4 MHz, far higher than conventional quartz watches.</p>
        <p>The Chronomaster series demonstrates that Citizen can compete at the highest levels of watchmaking while maintaining their commitment to innovative technology.</p>
        
        <h2>Promaster: Tools for Professionals</h2>
        <p>The Promaster collection showcases Citizen's expertise in creating professional-grade tool watches. Launched in 1989, Promaster includes dive watches rated to 1000 meters, pilot watches with aviation-specific functions, and land watches built for extreme conditions.</p>
        <p>These aren't just styled to look tough—they're ISO-certified instruments used by actual divers, pilots, and adventurers worldwide.</p>
        
        <h2>Satellite Wave and GPS Technology</h2>
        <p>In 2011, Citizen introduced Satellite Wave technology, allowing watches to receive time signals from GPS satellites anywhere on Earth. This means perfect accuracy regardless of location, with automatic time zone adjustment. The technology represents another first for Citizen and continues their tradition of practical innovation.</p>
        
        <h2>Miyota: Powering the World</h2>
        <p>Through their Miyota subsidiary, Citizen produces movements used by hundreds of watch brands worldwide. When you see an affordable automatic or quartz watch, there's a good chance it contains a Miyota movement. This makes Citizen one of the most important movement manufacturers in the world, even if the Citizen name doesn't appear on the dial.</p>
        
        <h2>Citizen Today</h2>
        <p>Modern Citizen offers an incredibly diverse range, from sub-$100 Eco-Drive watches to the premium Chronomaster line. They've also expanded through acquisitions, bringing Bulova and Frederique Constant into the Citizen family.</p>
        <p>The company remains committed to their founding vision: quality watches accessible to everyone. Whether you're buying your first watch or adding a high-accuracy piece to a collection, Citizen offers genuine value and proven technology that serves millions of citizens worldwide.</p>
