    <article class="article-content">
        <p class="lead-paragraph">Whether you're a collector planning future sales or simply protecting your investment, preserving resale value requires intentional care from day one. Here's how to maintain your watch's worth over time.</p>
        
        <h2>Keep Everything</h2>
        <p><strong>Box and papers matter:</strong> Complete sets—original box, warranty card, instruction manual, hang tags—command 10-30% premiums over naked watches. Store these items safely from day one.</p>
        <p><strong>Original accessories:</strong> Extra links, original straps, and any accessories that came with the watch add value. Even if you sized the bracelet and don't need extra links, keep them.</p>
        <p><strong>Purchase documentation:</strong> Original receipts prove authenticity and ownership history. Insurance documents and appraisals provide additional provenance.</p>
        
        <h2>Service Records</h2>
        <p><strong>Document all service:</strong> Keep receipts and documentation for every service. This proves the watch has been properly maintained and helps buyers trust the purchase.</p>
        <p><strong>Authorized service preferred:</strong> For luxury brands, authorized service center records strengthen resale value more than independent service records.</p>
        <p><strong>Regular maintenance:</strong> A watch with documented regular service is worth more than one with unknown service history. The cost of service is partially recovered in resale value.</p>
        
        <h2>Physical Condition</h2>
        <p><strong>Avoid unnecessary scratches:</strong> Careful wearing prevents cosmetic damage. Small scratches are expected; deep gouges and dents significantly impact value.</p>
        <p><strong>Don't over-polish:</strong> Light polishing can refresh a case. Heavy polishing removes metal, changes case shape, and reduces value—especially on vintage pieces. When in doubt, don't polish.</p>
        <p><strong>Protect the crystal:</strong> Crystal scratches (especially on sapphire) are expensive to repair. Crystal replacement can affect originality value on vintage pieces.</p>
        
        <h2>Original Parts</h2>
        <p><strong>Keep original components:</strong> If service requires part replacement, keep original parts. Original dials, hands, bezels, and crowns have value even when worn.</p>
        <p><strong>Avoid modifications:</strong> Aftermarket parts, custom dials, or non-original straps reduce value for most buyers. Keep watches as the manufacturer intended.</p>
        <p><strong>Period-correct replacements:</strong> If parts must be replaced, use period-correct genuine parts rather than modern replacements or aftermarket alternatives.</p>
        
        <h2>Smart Wearing Habits</h2>
        <p><strong>Rotate your collection:</strong> Daily wear accelerates aging. Rotating between watches spreads wear across multiple pieces.</p>
        <p><strong>Match watch to activity:</strong> Wear appropriate watches for activities. Don't wear a dress watch while doing yard work. This common-sense approach prevents unnecessary damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Travel carefully:</strong> Watches face risks during travel—security, theft, impacts. Consider which watches to travel with versus leave secured at home.</p>
        
        <h2>Proper Storage</h2>
        <p><strong>Climate control:</strong> Extreme temperatures and humidity damage watches and accelerate lubricant degradation. Store in stable, climate-controlled environments.</p>
        <p><strong>Secure storage:</strong> Theft is the ultimate value destroyer. Safes, safe deposit boxes, or secure home storage protect significant collections.</p>
        <p><strong>Individual protection:</strong> Store watches in individual pouches or boxes to prevent them from scratching each other.</p>
        
        <h2>Insurance</h2>
        <p><strong>Adequate coverage:</strong> Insure valuable watches at current market value, not purchase price. Markets change; coverage should reflect current replacement cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Updated appraisals:</strong> Get watches appraised every few years to ensure coverage remains adequate as values change.</p>
        <p><strong>Documentation for claims:</strong> Photographs, serial numbers, and condition documentation support insurance claims if needed.</p>
        
        <h2>Market Awareness</h2>
        <p><strong>Understand your model's market:</strong> Some watches appreciate; most depreciate. Understanding your specific model's market trajectory informs care and selling decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Timing matters:</strong> Watch markets fluctuate. Selling during high demand periods maximizes value. This requires following market trends.</p>
        <p><strong>Condition expectations:</strong> Know what condition the market expects for your watch's age. A 20-year-old watch in "too perfect" condition raises authenticity questions.</p>
        
        <h2>When Ready to Sell</h2>
        <p><strong>Professional photography:</strong> Quality photos showing condition accurately help achieve fair prices. Poor photos suggest something to hide.</p>
        <p><strong>Complete disclosure:</strong> Honest description of service history, condition, and any issues builds buyer trust and prevents disputes.</p>
        <p><strong>Choose selling venue wisely:</strong> Different venues suit different watches. Auction houses for rare pieces, dealers for quick sales, private sales for maximum return.</p>
        
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Resale value preservation isn't about treating watches like museum pieces—it's about thoughtful ownership. Wear and enjoy your watches, but do so carefully. Keep documentation, maintain properly, and make decisions that future buyers will appreciate.</p>
