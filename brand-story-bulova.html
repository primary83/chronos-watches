        <p class="lead-paragraph">Bulova invented the tuning fork watch, pioneered electronic timekeeping, and sent their technology to the Moon. This American brand transformed how the world kept time, yet remains accessible to everyday collectors.</p>
        
        <h2>Immigrant Dreams in New York</h2>
        <p>Joseph Bulova, a Bohemian immigrant, founded J. Bulova Company in New York City in 1875. Starting as a small jewelry shop on Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan, Bulova began manufacturing watches in 1912 at a factory in Bienne, Switzerland. The combination of American business acumen and Swiss craftsmanship would define the brand.</p>
        <p>By the 1920s, Bulova had established itself as a leading American watch company, known for quality timepieces at fair prices.</p>
        
        <h2>Broadcasting Pioneer</h2>
        <p>Bulova was a pioneer in advertising. On July 1, 1941, Bulova aired the first-ever television commercial—a simple image of a clock face with the Bulova logo, broadcast before a baseball game. The ten-second spot cost just $9. This innovative marketing approach kept Bulova at the forefront of American consciousness.</p>
        <p>The company's radio advertising was equally groundbreaking, with the famous tagline "America runs on Bulova time" becoming part of the national lexicon.</p>
        
        <h2>The Accutron Revolution</h2>
        <p>In 1960, Bulova changed watchmaking forever with the Accutron. Instead of a traditional balance wheel, the Accutron used a tuning fork vibrating at 360 Hz to regulate time—the first electronic watch movement. The result was unprecedented accuracy: within two seconds per day, far exceeding mechanical watches.</p>
        <p>The Accutron's distinctive hum—audible when held to the ear—and its smooth, sweeping second hand became iconic. The movement's precision made it suitable for applications beyond wristwatches, including aviation instruments, railroad timekeeping, and space exploration.</p>
        
        <h2>To the Moon</h2>
        <p>Bulova Accutron technology went to the Moon. While Omega's Speedmaster famously accompanied astronauts on their wrists, Accutron timing mechanisms were used in NASA instruments aboard Apollo missions. The Apollo 15 mission in 1971 included a Bulova timer on the lunar surface.</p>
        <p>This space heritage represents the pinnacle of Accutron's reputation for precision under extreme conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>The Spaceview</h2>
        <p>The Accutron Spaceview became one of the most distinctive watches ever made. Originally, the exposed tuning fork movement was intended only for dealer display models, but customer demand led Bulova to produce it for retail sale. The Spaceview's visible electronics created a futuristic aesthetic that remains striking today.</p>
        <p>Vintage Spaceviews are highly collectible, representing a unique moment in horological history when electronic and mechanical technologies intersected.</p>
        
        <h2>Precisionist: The Modern Chapter</h2>
        <p>In 2010, Bulova introduced the Precisionist, featuring a three-prong quartz crystal vibrating at 262 kHz—far higher than standard quartz watches. The result is accuracy within ten seconds per year and a smooth, sweeping second hand reminiscent of the original Accutron.</p>
        <p>The Precisionist represents Bulova's continued commitment to precision innovation, carrying forward the spirit of the tuning fork revolution for the modern era.</p>
        
        <h2>CURV: World's First Curved Chronograph</h2>
        <p>In 2016, Bulova introduced CURV, the world's first curved chronograph movement. Designed to fit the natural curve of the wrist, CURV demonstrated that Bulova still pursued meaningful innovation rather than simply trading on heritage.</p>
        
        <h2>Citizen Ownership</h2>
        <p>Bulova became part of Citizen Watch Company in 2008. This Japanese ownership has provided resources for continued development while allowing Bulova to maintain its American identity and heritage. The combination of Japanese manufacturing expertise and American design sensibility has strengthened the brand.</p>
        
        <h2>Archive Series</h2>
        <p>Bulova's Archive Series reissues classic designs from the brand's history, including military watches from World War II and iconic mid-century styles. These releases connect modern buyers to Bulova's rich heritage while offering vintage aesthetics with contemporary reliability.</p>
        
        <h2>Bulova Today</h2>
        <p>Modern Bulova offers exceptional value: Precisionist accuracy, Swiss automatic movements, and distinctive designs at accessible prices. While the brand may lack the prestige of Swiss luxury houses, it offers genuine horological innovation and American heritage. From the tuning fork to the Moon and beyond, Bulova has earned its place in watchmaking history.</p>
