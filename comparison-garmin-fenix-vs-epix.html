        <section id="introduction">
            <p>Garmin's premium multisport watches split into two display philosophies: the Fenix's memory-in-pixel (MIP) LCD prioritizes battery endurance, while the Epix's AMOLED delivers vibrant visuals. Both share identical sensors, software, and features—the choice distills to display preference and battery priorities.</p>

        <section id="fenix">
            <h2>Garmin Fenix 8</h2>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> $999 - $1,199 | <strong>Display:</strong> MIP LCD | <strong>Battery:</strong> Up to 48 days (smartwatch mode)</p>
            <p>The Fenix's transflective MIP display excels in bright sunlight without backlighting—ideal for outdoor athletes. The display remains always-on without significant battery impact. Weeks of battery life between charges suits multi-day adventures, ultramarathons, and expedition use.</p>
            <p>Visual quality appears muted compared to AMOLED—adequate for data display but less impressive for maps and rich graphics. Outdoor athletes prioritizing endurance over aesthetics find the tradeoff worthwhile.</p>

        <section id="epix">
            <h2>Garmin Epix Pro</h2>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> $899 - $1,099 | <strong>Display:</strong> AMOLED | <strong>Battery:</strong> Up to 16 days (smartwatch mode)</p>
            <p>The Epix's AMOLED display delivers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent visibility in all conditions. Maps render beautifully; data screens pop with clarity. The premium visual experience rivals luxury smartwatches.</p>
            <p>Battery life, while reduced compared to Fenix, remains excellent by smartwatch standards—16 days exceeds most competitors significantly. Gesture-based wake activation manages power consumption effectively.</p>
