        <h1>Panerai</h1>
        <p style="color: var(--silver);">Since 1860 — Italian Design, Swiss Heart</p>
    </section>

    <article class="content">
        <p>Panerai is watchmaking's most improbable success story. For most of its existence, the company made precision instruments for the Italian Navy—classified equipment unavailable to civilians. Then Sylvester Stallone discovered a vintage Panerai in a Rome shop, wore it in a movie, and ignited a craze for oversized Italian dive watches that transformed the entire industry.</p>

        <h2>Florence Origins (1860)</h2>
        <p>Giovanni Panerai opened a watchmaking school and shop in Florence's Piazza San Giovanni in 1860. The location, across from the Duomo, became a gathering place for Florence's intellectuals and scientists. More importantly, it established Panerai as an official supplier to the Royal Italian Navy.</p>
        <p>For decades, Panerai focused on precision instruments: compasses, depth gauges, timing devices, and luminous sights for torpedoes. The company developed expertise in luminous materials—first radium-based compounds, later tritium—that would define its watches.</p>

        <h2>The Radiomir (1936)</h2>
        <p>In 1936, the Italian Navy approached Panerai to develop a watch for its elite frogmen—the Decima Flottiglia MAS who conducted underwater sabotage missions. The result was the Radiomir, named after the radium-based luminous material Panerai had patented.</p>
        <p>The Radiomir featured a cushion-shaped case (47mm—enormous for the era), wire lugs, and a dial so luminous it could be read in complete darkness. These weren't elegant timepieces; they were instruments of war. Only about 300 were ever made for military use.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Military Secret:</strong> Panerai watches were classified Italian military equipment until the 1990s. They were issued, not sold, and service members had to return them when leaving the Navy. This scarcity explains both their collector value and why so few people knew they existed.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Luminor (1949)</h2>
        <p>In 1949, Panerai replaced radium (which was dangerously radioactive) with a new compound called Luminor (based on tritium). This gave its name to a new watch featuring Panerai's most distinctive element: the crown-protecting bridge device.</p>
        <p>The Luminor's lever-operated crown guard created an unmistakable silhouette. Combined with the large cushion case, sandwich dial (where luminous material shows through cutouts in the top dial layer), and minimal design, the Luminor became one of the most recognizable watches ever made.</p>

        <h2>The Stallone Effect (1995)</h2>
        <p>In 1995, Sylvester Stallone walked into a vintage watch shop in Rome and discovered Panerai. He was so taken with the oversized military aesthetics that he bought several and wore them in the movie Daylight (1996). He reportedly suggested Panerai create a commercial version.</p>
        <p>The timing was perfect. Vendôme Group (later Richemont) acquired Panerai in 1997 and launched civilian production. Watch collectors, starved for something different from traditional Swiss designs, went crazy. The oversized case—once a liability—became the selling point.</p>

        <h2>Impact on the Industry</h2>
        <p>Panerai's success changed watchmaking. Before the late 1990s, men's watches typically measured 36-40mm. Panerai proved that men would buy 44mm, 47mm, even 52mm watches. Suddenly, every brand released larger models. The "oversized watch" trend that dominated the 2000s traces directly back to Panerai.</p>

        <h2>Manufacture Movements</h2>
        <p>Originally, Panerai used modified movements from other suppliers (notably Rolex in the military era, then ETA for early civilian production). Since 2005, Panerai has developed in-house calibers at its Neuchâtel manufacture. The P.9000 series offers eight-day power reserve; the P.4000 introduced a unique micro-rotor design.</p>

        <h2>Today's Panerai</h2>
        <p>The current collection spans three main families: Luminor (with crown guard), Radiomir (without), and Submersible (dive-focused with rotating bezel). Case sizes have moderated somewhat—42mm and 44mm are now common—though larger options remain for enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>Panerai occupies a unique position: Italian heritage, Swiss manufacture, military credibility, and celebrity cachet. The watches are instantly recognizable, polarizing (some find them too large), and undeniably distinctive. From secret military equipment to global luxury brand, Panerai's journey is unlike any other in watchmaking.</p>
