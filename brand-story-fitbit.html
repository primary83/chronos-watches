        <h2>The Beginning: A TechCrunch Moment</h2>
        <p>In 2007, <strong>James Park</strong> and <strong>Eric Friedman</strong> had a simple idea: what if you could track your daily physical activity with a small, wearable device? Inspired by the Nintendo Wii's motion controls, they believed sensor technology was finally cheap enough to make consumer fitness tracking practical.</p>
        <p>They launched at TechCrunch 50 in September 2008 with little more than a prototype and a pitch deck. The response was overwhelming—they took 2,000 pre-orders in the first week, despite not having a finished product.</p>
        <p>The original Fitbit Tracker finally shipped in 2009. It was a small clip-on device that counted steps, tracked distance, and estimated calories burned. It wasn't the first pedometer, but it was the first to connect wirelessly to the internet and sync data to a user's computer.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>The 10,000 Steps Phenomenon:</strong> Fitbit didn't invent the 10,000 steps goal (it originated with a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign), but they popularized it globally. The default goal became so ubiquitous that "10,000 steps" entered everyday vocabulary.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Creating a Category (2010-2014)</h2>
        <p>Fitbit didn't just make products—they created the "fitness tracker" category. Before Fitbit, fitness technology meant expensive gym equipment or professional sports gadgets. After Fitbit, millions of ordinary people became obsessed with their daily step counts.</p>
        <p>The company's growth was remarkable. The Fitbit Flex (2013), worn on the wrist like a bracelet, made fitness tracking fashionable. The Fitbit Charge (2014) added a display. Each generation expanded what "fitness tracking" meant.</p>
        <p>Key to Fitbit's success was the <strong>social competition</strong> features. Users could challenge friends to step competitions, creating addictive engagement loops. Workplaces started "Fitbit challenges." Health insurance companies offered discounts for hitting activity goals.</p>

        <h3>The Community Effect</h3>
        <p>Fitbit understood something competitors missed: fitness isn't just about data—it's about motivation. Their app created a community where users celebrated achievements, competed on leaderboards, and encouraged each other. This social layer made Fitbit sticky in a way that pure hardware couldn't match.</p>

        <h2>Going Public and Growing Pains (2015-2017)</h2>
        <p>Fitbit went public in June 2015 at $20 per share, valuing the company at $4.1 billion. It was one of the largest consumer tech IPOs in years. The future seemed unlimited.</p>
        <p>Then Apple Watch launched.</p>
        <p>Apple's entry into wearables in April 2015 changed everything. Suddenly, Fitbit wasn't competing with other fitness trackers—they were competing with the world's most valuable company. Apple could bundle fitness features with notifications, apps, and Apple's ecosystem integration.</p>
        <p>Fitbit's stock price began a painful decline. The company responded by pushing into smartwatches with products like the Fitbit Blaze and later Fitbit Versa, but they struggled to match Apple's polish and ecosystem advantages.</p>

        <h2>The Health Pivot</h2>
        <p>As the smartwatch wars intensified, Fitbit found a differentiator: <strong>health-focused features</strong> that went beyond step counting. The Fitbit Sense introduced stress management (EDA sensor), skin temperature tracking, and FDA-cleared ECG monitoring.</p>
        <p>Sleep tracking became a particular strength. Fitbit's sleep analysis—including sleep stages, sleep scores, and personalized insights—was widely regarded as the best in the industry. While Apple Watch owners had to charge at night, Fitbit users tracked their sleep.</p>
        <p>The company also invested heavily in health research, partnering with medical institutions to study how wearable data could detect health conditions early. Their research has contributed to understanding of COVID-19, heart disease, and sleep disorders.</p>

        <h2>The Google Era (2021-Present)</h2>
        <p>In November 2019, Google announced its intention to acquire Fitbit for $2.1 billion. After extended regulatory review—particularly in Europe, where data privacy concerns were paramount—the deal closed in January 2021.</p>
        <p>The acquisition made strategic sense for both companies. Google needed Fitbit's health expertise and hardware experience to compete with Apple Watch. Fitbit needed Google's resources, AI capabilities, and ecosystem to survive in an increasingly competitive market.</p>

        <h3>Google Integration</h3>
        <p>Post-acquisition Fitbit devices have gained Google features: Google Maps navigation, Google Wallet payments, Google Assistant voice control. The Fitbit Charge 6, released in 2023, was the first product to fully integrate Google services.</p>
        <p>More significantly, Fitbit's health tracking now powers Google's Pixel Watch. The relationship is symbiotic: Pixel Watch brings Fitbit to premium smartwatch buyers, while Fitbit trackers serve users who want focused fitness devices without smartwatch complexity.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>The Fitbit Premium Model:</strong> Fitbit pioneered subscription services for wearables with Fitbit Premium. For $9.99/month, users get deeper insights, personalized guidance, and exclusive workouts. This recurring revenue model has become increasingly important as hardware margins shrink.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Fitbit's Enduring Strengths</h2>
        <p>Despite fierce competition, Fitbit maintains distinct advantages:</p>
        <p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> While Apple Watch needs daily charging, most Fitbits last 6-10 days. For sleep tracking—a Fitbit specialty—this matters enormously.</p>
        <p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Not everyone wants a smartwatch. Fitbit offers focused fitness devices without the complexity and distraction of full smartwatch features.</p>
        <p><strong>Price Accessibility:</strong> Starting at $99 for the Inspire, Fitbit makes fitness tracking accessible to everyone. Apple Watch SE starts at $249; Garmin's cheapest is $199.</p>
        <p><strong>Sleep Expertise:</strong> Fitbit's sleep tracking remains industry-leading. Sleep stages, sleep scores, Smart Wake alarms, and detailed insights have no equal in the mainstream market.</p>

        <h2>The Legacy and Future</h2>
        <p>Fitbit's impact extends far beyond their own products. They proved that ordinary people—not just athletes—care about their health data. They made step counting mainstream. They created the expectation that wearables should track sleep, stress, and heart rate.</p>
        <p>Under Google's ownership, Fitbit continues to evolve. The brand now serves as Google's health and fitness platform, with technology appearing in Pixel Watch alongside standalone Fitbit devices. Google's AI capabilities are being integrated to provide smarter, more personalized health insights.</p>
        <p>The company that started with a simple step counter has become part of one of the world's largest technology ecosystems. But the core mission remains: helping people live healthier, more active lives—one step at a time.</p>
