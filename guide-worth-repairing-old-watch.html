        <p class="lead-paragraph">Your grandfather's watch, a flea market find, or a forgotten piece from your own past—old watches present a question: repair or replace? The answer depends on economics, emotions, and what the watch truly means to you.</p>
        
        <h2>The Economic Calculation</h2>
        <p>Pure economics suggests comparing repair costs against the watch's market value. If service costs $400 and the watch is worth $200, repair doesn't make economic sense. You could buy another identical watch for less than repair costs.</p>
        <p>But this calculation misses important factors. That $200 watch may not be replaceable if it's a specific family piece. And a properly serviced watch may gain value or last another several decades.</p>
        
        <h2>When Repair Makes Economic Sense</h2>
        <p><strong>Valuable vintage pieces:</strong> A vintage Omega Seamaster worth $1,500 is absolutely worth $400 in service—it'll run another decade and may appreciate.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality brands holding value:</strong> Rolex, Patek Philippe, and similar brands almost always justify repair. Their resale value typically exceeds service costs.</p>
        <p><strong>Rare or discontinued models:</strong> If you can't easily replace the watch, repair preserves something irreplaceable regardless of market value.</p>
        <p><strong>Watches with appreciation potential:</strong> Some undervalued vintage watches are gaining collector interest. Repair now may prove wise later.</p>
        
        <h2>When Replacement Makes Economic Sense</h2>
        <p><strong>Mass-produced quartz watches:</strong> A generic quartz watch from the 1990s probably isn't worth professional service. Replacement is cheaper.</p>
        <p><strong>Heavily damaged pieces:</strong> When repair costs approach or exceed the watch's value and you have no emotional attachment, replacement makes sense.</p>
        <p><strong>Fashion watches:</strong> Fashion brand watches rarely justify expensive repair unless they have specific sentimental value.</p>
        <p><strong>Available identical replacements:</strong> If you can buy the same model cheaper than repair costs, and it holds no special significance, consider replacement.</p>
        
        <h2>The Sentimental Calculation</h2>
        <p>Economics shouldn't dominate decisions about family pieces. Your father's $150 Timex from 1975 has value no market can measure. The cost to repair it preserves connection to him—priceless for many people.</p>
        <p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong> Will you wear this watch? Will it be passed down again? What memories does it carry? Would the original owner want it preserved?</p>
        <p>If the answers suggest meaningful connection, repair makes sense regardless of economics.</p>
        
        <h2>Assessing Repairability</h2>
        <p><strong>Parts availability:</strong> Some old watches have readily available parts. Others have parts that are impossible to find. Ask a watchmaker about parts availability before committing.</p>
        <p><strong>Extent of damage:</strong> Surface issues (scratched crystal, worn crown) are usually repairable. Severe water damage, missing parts, or corroded movements may be beyond economical repair.</p>
        <p><strong>Movement condition:</strong> A neglected but intact movement usually can be restored. A movement with broken staff, destroyed escapement, or seized components may require expensive specialist work.</p>
        
        <h2>Getting an Assessment</h2>
        <p>Before deciding, have a qualified watchmaker examine the piece. Most charge nothing or minimal fees for assessment. They'll identify what's needed and provide realistic estimates. This information enables informed decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Get written estimates</strong> specifying what work is included. Understand what might add cost once the watch is opened and examined more thoroughly.</p>
        
        <h2>Repair Options for Different Budgets</h2>
        <p><strong>Full restoration:</strong> Complete service, new parts as needed, case refinishing if desired. The watch emerges in best possible condition. Appropriate for valuable pieces and important family heirlooms.</p>
        <p><strong>Basic service:</strong> Clean, oil, and regulate without extensive parts replacement. Gets the watch running properly at lower cost. Appropriate for sentimental pieces where perfect function matters more than perfect condition.</p>
        <p><strong>Minimal intervention:</strong> Address only what's necessary to make it run. Lowest cost, but doesn't address developing problems. Appropriate when budget is severely limited.</p>
        
        <h2>Preserving vs. Restoring</h2>
        <p>For vintage watches, consider whether full restoration is appropriate. Aggressive polishing removes original finish. New dials and hands eliminate patina collectors value. Sometimes preserving original condition—even imperfect—is better than making a watch look new.</p>
        <p>Discuss options with your watchmaker. A light service that preserves character may be more appropriate than aggressive restoration that erases history.</p>
        
        <h2>The Hidden Value</h2>
        <p>Old watches often carry value beyond their price tags. A working watch connects past and present—wear something your grandfather wore, feel what he felt when checking time. This experiential value justifies repair costs that pure economics might question.</p>
        <p>Additionally, properly serviced mechanical watches can run indefinitely with periodic maintenance. Your investment in repair today serves decades of future use.</p>
        
        <h2>Making the Decision</h2>
        <p>Ask yourself: In ten years, will I regret not repairing this watch? If the answer is yes, repair it. The money spent preserves something irreplaceable. If the answer is no—if it would just sit in a drawer anyway—perhaps let it go or pass it to someone who'll appreciate it more.</p>
