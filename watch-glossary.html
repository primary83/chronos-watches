        <p class="lead-paragraph">Understanding watch terminology transforms confusing specifications into meaningful information. This glossary covers essential terms every watch enthusiast should know, from basic concepts to advanced complications.</p>
        
        <h2>A</h2>
        <h3>Automatic Movement</h3>
        <p>A mechanical movement that winds itself using a rotor that spins with wrist motion. Also called "self-winding." No battery required—the watch runs on mechanical energy stored in the mainspring.</p>
        
        <h3>Amplitude</h3>
        <p>The arc of the balance wheel's swing, measured in degrees. Healthy automatic movements typically show 250-310 degrees. Low amplitude can indicate service needs.</p>
        
        <h3>Annual Calendar</h3>
        <p>A complication that automatically adjusts for months with 30 or 31 days, requiring manual correction only once per year (at the end of February).</p>
        
        <h2>B</h2>
        <h3>Balance Wheel</h3>
        <p>The oscillating wheel that regulates timekeeping in mechanical watches. It swings back and forth at a consistent rate, typically 21,600 to 36,000 times per hour.</p>
        
        <h3>Bezel</h3>
        <p>The ring surrounding the watch crystal. May be fixed, rotating (for timing), or decorative. Dive watches feature unidirectional bezels that only rotate counterclockwise for safety.</p>
        
        <h3>Beat Rate (BPH)</h3>
        <p>Beats per hour—how many times the balance wheel oscillates hourly. Common rates: 21,600 (6 beats/second), 28,800 (8 beats/second), or 36,000 (10 beats/second). Higher rates generally mean smoother seconds hand motion.</p>
        
        <h2>C</h2>
        <h3>Caliber</h3>
        <p>The specific movement design, usually identified by a number (e.g., Rolex Caliber 3235, ETA 2824). Indicates the movement's specifications and manufacturer.</p>
        
        <h3>Chronograph</h3>
        <p>A watch with stopwatch function. Pushers start, stop, and reset the timing function. Sub-dials display elapsed seconds, minutes, and sometimes hours.</p>
        
        <h3>Chronometer</h3>
        <p>A watch certified for accuracy by an official testing institute (usually COSC). Must meet strict precision standards over multiple days in various positions and temperatures.</p>
        
        <h3>COSC</h3>
        <p>Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres—the Swiss official chronometer testing institute. Certifies movements meeting accuracy standards of -4/+6 seconds per day.</p>
        
        <h3>Complication</h3>
        <p>Any function beyond basic timekeeping. Date displays, chronographs, moon phases, and perpetual calendars are all complications.</p>
        
        <h3>Crown</h3>
        <p>The knob used to wind the watch and set the time. Screw-down crowns thread into the case for improved water resistance.</p>
        
        <h2>D</h2>
        <h3>Date Window</h3>
        <p>An aperture displaying the date, typically at 3 o'clock. Some feature magnifying "cyclops" lenses for easier reading.</p>
        
        <h3>Dial</h3>
        <p>The watch face displaying time. Materials include metal, enamel, lacquer, mother-of-pearl, or stone. The dial holds indices (markers) and supports the hands.</p>
        
        <h3>Deployment Clasp (Deployant)</h3>
        <p>A folding clasp that opens the bracelet without fully detaching it. Provides security and reduces wear on leather straps.</p>
        
        <h2>E</h2>
        <h3>Escapement</h3>
        <p>The mechanism that controls energy release from the mainspring to the balance wheel, creating the characteristic "tick" sound. Types include lever, co-axial, and deadbeat escapements.</p>
        
        <h3>ETA</h3>
        <p>The largest Swiss movement manufacturer, supplying movements to many brands. Common calibers include ETA 2824 (automatic) and ETA 7750 (chronograph).</p>
        
        <h2>F</h2>
        <h3>Flyback</h3>
        <p>A chronograph feature allowing instant reset and restart with a single button press, without stopping first. Useful for timing consecutive events.</p>
        
        <h2>G</h2>
        <h3>GMT</h3>
        <p>A complication displaying a second time zone using an additional hand and 24-hour bezel. Originally designed for pilots crossing time zones.</p>
        
        <h3>Guilloche</h3>
        <p>A decorative pattern of precise, interlocking lines engraved on dials. Traditional guilloche is engine-turned by machine; modern versions may be stamped.</p>
        
        <h2>H</h2>
        <h3>Hacking</h3>
        <p>A feature that stops the seconds hand when the crown is pulled out for time-setting. Allows precise synchronization to a reference time.</p>
        
        <h3>Hand-winding</h3>
        <p>A mechanical movement wound manually by turning the crown. Also called "manual wind." Requires daily winding to maintain power.</p>
        
        <h3>Helium Escape Valve</h3>
        <p>A valve allowing helium to escape from the case during decompression after saturation diving. Found on professional dive watches rated beyond 300m.</p>
        
        <h2>I</h2>
        <h3>In-House Movement</h3>
        <p>A movement designed and manufactured by the watch brand itself, rather than sourced from external suppliers. Indicates higher investment in manufacturing capability.</p>
        
        <h3>Index</h3>
        <p>Hour markers on the dial—may be applied (raised), printed, or painted. Types include stick indices, Arabic numerals, and Roman numerals.</p>
        
        <h2>J</h2>
        <h3>Jewels</h3>
        <p>Synthetic rubies used as bearings in movements to reduce friction. More jewels isn't necessarily better—17-25 jewels is typical for quality automatics. Unnecessary jewels are sometimes added for marketing.</p>
        
        <h2>L</h2>
        <h3>Lug-to-Lug</h3>
        <p>The measurement from the top of one lug to the bottom of the opposite lug. Determines how a watch fits on the wrist—sometimes more important than case diameter.</p>
        
        <h3>Lume (Luminous Material)</h3>
        <p>Phosphorescent material applied to hands and indices for visibility in darkness. Modern watches use Super-LumiNova; vintage watches may contain radioactive tritium or radium.</p>
        
        <h2>M</h2>
        <h3>Mainspring</h3>
        <p>The coiled spring storing energy in mechanical watches. When wound (manually or automatically), it powers the movement as it slowly unwinds.</p>
        
        <h3>Manufacture</h3>
        <p>A watch company that produces its own movements in-house, rather than sourcing from suppliers. True manufacture status indicates significant vertical integration.</p>
        
        <h3>Moon Phase</h3>
        <p>A complication displaying the current lunar phase through an aperture showing a moon disc rotating beneath. Astronomical moon phases cycle every 29.5 days.</p>
        
        <h2>P</h2>
        <h3>Perpetual Calendar</h3>
        <p>A complication that automatically accounts for different month lengths and leap years, requiring no manual adjustment until 2100 (when the leap year exception occurs).</p>
        
        <h3>Power Reserve</h3>
        <p>How long a mechanical watch runs when fully wound before stopping. Typically 38-72 hours for modern automatics. Some watches display remaining power reserve on the dial.</p>
        
        <h3>Pusher</h3>
        <p>Buttons on the case used to control functions—typically chronograph start/stop and reset. Distinguished from the crown, which sets time.</p>
        
        <h2>Q</h2>
        <h3>Quartz Movement</h3>
        <p>A battery-powered movement using a vibrating quartz crystal for timekeeping. More accurate than mechanical movements (+/- 15 seconds per month typical) but lacks the craftsmanship appeal of mechanical watches.</p>
        
        <h2>R</h2>
        <h3>Rotor</h3>
        <p>The semicircular weight in automatic movements that spins with wrist motion to wind the mainspring. Visible through exhibition casebacks.</p>
        
        <h2>S</h2>
        <h3>Sapphire Crystal</h3>
        <p>Synthetic sapphire used for watch crystals—extremely scratch-resistant (9 on Mohs scale, after diamond). May be flat, domed, or box-shaped. Can shatter on impact unlike acrylic.</p>
        
        <h3>Skeleton</h3>
        <p>A watch with material removed from the movement and/or dial to reveal the mechanism beneath. Shows the working parts but may reduce durability.</p>
        
        <h2>T</h2>
        <h3>Tourbillon</h3>
        <p>A rotating cage containing the escapement, designed to counter gravity's effects on accuracy. Originally invented for pocket watches; now primarily a demonstration of craftsmanship rather than practical necessity in wristwatches.</p>
        
        <h2>W</h2>
        <h3>Water Resistance</h3>
        <p>Rated in meters, atmospheres (ATM), or bars. 30m = splash resistant; 100m = swimming; 200m+ = diving. Ratings assume static pressure—actual use involves additional forces.</p>
        
        <h3>Winding Stem</h3>
        <p>The shaft connecting the crown to the movement, transmitting winding and time-setting inputs.</p>
