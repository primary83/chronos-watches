    <article class="article-content">
        <p class="lead-paragraph">Vintage watches demand different care than modern timepieces. Their aged components, obsolete gaskets, and historical significance require thoughtful handling. Here's what every vintage watch owner needs to know.</p>
        
        <h2>Water Resistance: Assume None</h2>
        <p>Original water resistance ratings are meaningless on vintage watches. Gaskets degrade over decades. Even a watch originally rated to 100m likely has compromised seals. Treat all vintage watches as non-water-resistant unless recently tested and re-sealed.</p>
        <p>Remove vintage watches before washing hands. A splash that modern watches ignore can devastate a vintage piece.</p>
        
        <h2>Fragile Crystals</h2>
        <p>Many vintage watches have acrylic (plastic) crystals that scratch easily but can be polished. Some have older mineral glass that shatters on impact. Neither provides the scratch resistance of modern sapphire. Handle accordingly.</p>
        <p>Acrylic crystal scratches can often be polished out with specialized compounds—a useful skill for vintage owners.</p>
        
        <h2>Radium and Tritium</h2>
        <p>Vintage watches from the 1950s and earlier may contain radium lume—now known to be radioactive. Watches from the 1960s-1990s typically used tritium (less radioactive, with a half-life of about 12 years). By now, most tritium has decayed and no longer glows.</p>
        <p>Don't attempt to re-lume vintage dials yourself. Original lume, even if no longer functional, contributes to collector value. And disturbing old radium is genuinely dangerous.</p>
        
        <h2>Gentle Winding</h2>
        <p>Old mainsprings are more fragile than modern ones. Wind vintage manual watches gently, stopping when you feel resistance. Over-winding doesn't "break" modern watches but can damage aged mainsprings in vintage pieces.</p>
        <p>For vintage automatics, hand-winding occasionally helps if you don't wear them daily, but be gentle.</p>
        
        <h2>Setting Time Carefully</h2>
        <p>On vintage watches with date functions, avoid setting the date between roughly 9 PM and 3 AM. During these hours, the calendar mechanism is engaged. Forcing the date change can damage worn gears. This rule applies even more stringently to vintage pieces than modern ones.</p>
        
        <h2>Service Considerations</h2>
        <p>Vintage watches often need parts that manufacturers no longer supply. Skilled watchmakers source donor parts, fabricate replacements, or carefully refurbish originals. This requires expertise that not all watchmakers possess.</p>
        <p>Find watchmakers who specialize in vintage pieces for your era and brand. Their knowledge of historical calibers and access to parts networks makes a difference.</p>
        
        <h2>Preserving Originality</h2>
        <p>Collectors value original components. Before any service, discuss with your watchmaker which parts to preserve versus replace. Original dials, hands, and crowns contribute significantly to value. Unnecessary replacements reduce collectibility.</p>
        <p>Avoid polishing vintage cases. Original finish, even with honest wear, often beats shiny over-polished cases in collector markets.</p>
        
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>Store vintage watches away from direct sunlight, which fades dials and degrades old lume. Humidity control matters more than for modern watches—old movements are less protected. Consider silica gel packets in your storage box.</p>
        
        <h2>Wearing Frequency</h2>
        <p>Regular wearing keeps lubricants distributed and movements exercised. But vintage watches may not tolerate daily wear like modern pieces. Consider vintage watches as occasional-wear pieces rather than daily drivers.</p>
        
        <h2>The Philosophy of Vintage Care</h2>
        <p>Vintage watch care balances preservation with enjoyment. These are historical objects—but they're also meant to be used. Find the balance that works for you: protecting the watch's integrity while still enjoying it as the functional timepiece it was made to be.</p>
