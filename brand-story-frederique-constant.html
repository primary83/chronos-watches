        <p class="lead-paragraph">Frederique Constant was built on a revolutionary premise: that Swiss watchmaking excellence shouldn't be reserved for the wealthy few. Their Heart Beat watches put haute horlogerie complications on wrists that never expected them.</p>
        
        <h2>A Family Dream in Geneva</h2>
        <p>Frederique Constant was founded in 1988 by Dutch entrepreneurs Peter Stas and his wife Aletta. Based in Plan-les-Ouates, Geneva, the company took its name from the great-grandparents of the founding couple: Frederique Schreiner and Constant Stas.</p>
        <p>The founders' vision was clear: create Swiss watches with genuine horological merit at prices accessible to aspiring collectors. They called this philosophy "accessible luxury"—a term that would define the brand.</p>
        
        <h2>The Heart Beat Revolution</h2>
        <p>In 1994, Frederique Constant introduced the Heart Beat, a watch featuring an aperture in the dial revealing the oscillating balance wheel—the beating heart of the mechanical movement. While open-heart designs existed before, Frederique Constant offered this complication at previously unthinkable prices.</p>
        <p>The Heart Beat became the brand's signature, allowing buyers to experience the romance of mechanical watchmaking without the premium prices of established luxury houses. It proved that horological drama was possible at accessible price points.</p>
        
        <h2>In-House Movement Development</h2>
        <p>In 2004, Frederique Constant achieved a major milestone: the development of their first in-house movement, the FC-910. This made them one of very few brands at their price level to produce proprietary calibers—a remarkable achievement for a company less than two decades old.</p>
        <p>The in-house movement development continued with calibers for world timer, perpetual calendar, and tourbillon complications. Each represented Frederique Constant's ambition to compete on technical merit, not just price.</p>
        
        <h2>Classic Manufacture</h2>
        <p>The Classic Manufacture collection showcases Frederique Constant's in-house capabilities. These watches feature the brand's own movements with moonphase, worldtimer, and perpetual calendar complications—functions typically associated with watches costing many times more.</p>
        <p>The quality of these movements and their finishing surprised skeptics who assumed that low prices meant inferior craftsmanship.</p>
        
        <h2>Highlife: Sports Luxury</h2>
        <p>The Highlife collection represents Frederique Constant's entry into the luxury sports watch segment. With its integrated bracelet design and refined aesthetics, Highlife competes with iconic designs from prestigious brands—at a fraction of the price.</p>
        <p>The Highlife demonstrates that Frederique Constant can design desirable, contemporary watches while maintaining their value-focused philosophy.</p>
        
        <h2>Horological Smartwatches</h2>
        <p>In 2015, Frederique Constant pioneered the "horological smartwatch" category—traditional watches with hidden connectivity features. These timepieces look like classic dress watches but include activity tracking, sleep monitoring, and smartphone connectivity.</p>
        <p>This innovation positioned Frederique Constant at the intersection of traditional watchmaking and modern technology, appealing to customers who wanted smart features without sacrificing classical aesthetics.</p>
        
        <h2>Citizen Acquisition</h2>
        <p>In 2016, Frederique Constant was acquired by Citizen Watch Company of Japan. This partnership provided resources for continued development while maintaining the brand's Geneva identity and accessible luxury positioning.</p>
        <p>Under Citizen ownership, Frederique Constant has continued developing new movements and collections, benefiting from the Japanese group's manufacturing expertise.</p>
        
        <h2>The Value Equation</h2>
        <p>What makes Frederique Constant remarkable is what you get for the money. An in-house perpetual calendar for under $10,000. A Swiss automatic with moonphase for around $1,000. These specifications simply don't match the price tags—which is exactly the point.</p>
        
        <h2>Frederique Constant Today</h2>
        <p>Operating from Geneva, Frederique Constant continues to challenge assumptions about price and quality in Swiss watchmaking. They've proven that accessible luxury isn't a contradiction—it's a philosophy that has brought genuine horological appreciation to thousands of collectors who might otherwise have been priced out of the market.</p>
